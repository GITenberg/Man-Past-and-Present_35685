<h2>PREFACE TO NEW EDITION</h2>


<p>Those who are familiar with the vast amount of ethnological
literature published since the close of last century
will realize that to revise and bring up to date a work whose
range in space and time covers the whole world from prehistoric
ages down to the present day, is a task impossible of accomplishment
within the compass of a single volume. Recent
discoveries have revolutionized our conception of primeval
man, while still providing abundant material for controversy,
and the rapidly increasing pile of ethnographical matter,
although a vast amount of spade work remains to be done, is
but one sign of the remarkable interest in ethnology which is
so conspicuous a feature of the present decade. Even to keep
abreast of the periodical literature devoted to his subject provides
ample occupation for the ethnologist and few are those
who can now lay claim to such an omniscient title.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances the faults of omission and compression
could not be avoided in revising Professor Keane's
work, but it is hoped that the copious references which form
a prominent feature of the present edition will compensate in
some measure for these obvious defects. The main object of
the revisers has been to retain as much as possible of the
original text wherever it fairly represents current opinion at
the present time, but so different is our outlook from that of
1899 that certain sections have had to be entirely rewritten
and in many places pages have been suppressed to make room
for more important information. In every case where new
matter has been inserted references are given to the responsible
authorities and the fullest use has been made of direct quotation
from the authors cited.</p>

<p>Mrs Hingston Quiggin is responsible for the whole work
of revision with the exception of Chapter XI, revised by
Miss Lilian Whitehouse, while Dr A. C. Haddon has criticized,
corrected and supervised the work throughout.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The World
peopled by Migration
from one
Center by Pleistocene
Man.</div>

<p>In order to a clear understanding of the many difficult
questions connected with the natural history of the human
family, two cardinal points have to be steadily
borne in mind&mdash;the specific unity of all existing
varieties, and the dispersal of their generalised
precursors over the whole world in pleistocene
times.  As both points have elsewhere been
dealt with by me somewhat fully<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, it will here suffice to show
their direct bearing on the general evolution of the human
species from that remote epoch to the present day.</p>

<p>It must be obvious that, if man is specifically one, though
not necessarily sprung of a single pair, he must have had, in
homely language, a single cradle-land, from which the peopling
of the earth was brought about by migration, not by independent
developments from different species in so many
independent geographical areas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Primary
Groups evolved
each in its
special Habitat.</div>

<p>It follows further, and this point is all-important, that,
since the world was peopled by pleistocene man, it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
peopled by a generalised proto-human form, prior to all
later racial differences. The existing groups, according to
this hypothesis, have developed in different areas independently
and divergently by continuous adaptation to their
several environments.  If they still constitute
mere varieties, and not distinct species, the
reason is because all come of like pleistocene
ancestry, while the divergences have been confined
to relatively narrow limits, that is, not wide enough to
be regarded zoologically as specific differences.</p>

<p>The battle between monogenists and polygenists cannot
be decided until more facts are at our disposal, and much
will doubtless be said on both sides for some time to come<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.
Among the views of human origins brought forward in recent
years should be mentioned the daring theory of Klaatsch<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.
Recognising two distinct human types, Neandertal and
Aurignac (see pp. 8, 9 below), and two distinct anthropoid
types, gorilla and orang-utan, he derives Neandertal man
and African gorilla from one common ancestor, and Aurignac
man and Asiatic orang-utan from another. Though anatomists,
especially those conversant with anthropoid structure<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>,
are not able to accept this view, they admit that many difficulties
may be solved by the recognition of more than one
primordial stock of human ancestors<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. The questions of
adaptation to climate and environment<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, the possibilities of
degeneracy, the varying degrees of physiological activity, of
successful mutations, the effects of crossing and all the complicated
problems of heredity are involved in the discussion,
and it must be acknowledged that our information concerning
all of these is entirely inadequate.</p>

<p>Nevertheless all speculations on the subject are not based
merely on hypotheses, and three discoveries of late years
have provided solid facts for the working out of the
problem.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Pleistocene
Man.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Pithecanthropus
erectus.</div>

<p>These discoveries were the remains of <i>Pithecanthropus
erectus</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> in Java, in 1892, of the Mauer jaw<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, near Heidelberg,
in 1907, and of the Piltdown skull<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> in Sussex in
1912. Although the Mauer jaw was accepted
without hesitation, the controversy concerning
the correct interpretation of the Javan fossils has been raging
for more than twenty years and shows no sign of abating,
while <i>Eoanthropus Dawsoni</i> is too recent an intruder into the
arena to be fairly dealt with at present. Certain facts however
stand out clearly. In late pliocene or early pleistocene
times certain early ancestral forms were already in existence
which can scarcely be excluded from the <i>Hominidae</i>. In
range they were as widely distributed as Java in the east to
Heidelberg and Sussex in the west, and in spite of divergence
in type a certain correlation is not impossible, even if the
Piltdown specimen should finally be regarded as representing
a distinct genus<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. Each contributes facts of the utmost importance
for the tracing out of the history of human evolution.
<i>Pithecanthropus</i> raises the vexed question as to
whether the erect attitude or brain development
came first in the story. The conjunction of pre-human
braincase with human thighbone appeared to favour
the popular view that the erect attitude was the earlier, but
the evidence of embryology suggests a reverse order. And
although at first the thighbone was recognised as distinctly
human it seems that of late doubts have been cast on this
interpretation<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, and even the claim to the title <i>erectus</i> is called
in question. The characters of straightness and slenderness
on which much stress was laid are found in exaggerated form
in gibbons and lemurs. The intermediate position in respect
of mental endowment (in so far as brain can be estimated by
cranial capacity) is shown in the accompanying diagram in
which the cranial measurements of <i>Pithecanthropus</i> are compared
with those of a chimpanzee and prehistoric man. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
teeth strengthen the evidence, for they are described as too
large for a man and too small for an ape. Thus <i>Pithecanthropus</i>
has been confidently assigned to a place in a branch
of the human family tree.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mauer jaw.

<p>The Mauer jaw, the geological age of which is undisputed,
also represents intermediate characters. The extraordinary
strength and thickness of bone, the wide ascending
ramus with shallow sigmoid notch
(distinctly simian features) and the total absence
of chin<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> would deny it a place among human jaws, but the
teeth, which are all fortunately preserved in their sockets, are
not only definitely human, but show in certain peculiarities
less simian features than are to be found in the dentition of
modern man<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Piltdown skull.
Eoanthropus
Dawsoni.</div>

<p>The cranial capacity of the Piltdown skull, though variously
estimated<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, is certainly greater than that of
<i>Pithecanthropus</i>, the general outlines with steeply
rounded forehead resemble that of modern
man, and the bones are almost without exception typically
human.  The jaw, however, though usually attributed to
the same individual<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, recalls the primitive features of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Mauer specimen in its thick ascending portion and shallow
notch, while in certain characters it differs from any known
jaw, ancient or modern<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. The evidence afforded by the teeth
is even more striking. The teeth of <i>Pithecanthropus</i> and of
<i>Homo Heidelbergensis</i> were recognised as remarkably human,
and although primitive in type, are far more advanced in the
line of human evolution than the lowly features with which
they are associated would lead one to expect. The Piltdown
teeth are more primitive in certain characters than those of
either the Javan or the Heidelberg remains. The first molar
has been compared to that of Taubach, the most ape-like of
human or pre-human teeth hitherto recorded, but the canine
tooth (found by P. Teilhard in the same stratum in 1913<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>) finds
no parallel in any known human jaw; it resembles the milk
canine of the chimpanzee more than that of the adult dentition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General view of
Pleistocene
Man.</div>

<p>It cannot be said that any clear view of pleistocene man
can be obtained from these imperfect scraps of
evidence, valuable though they are. Rather may
we agree with Keith that the problem grows
more instead of less complex. "In our first youthful burst
of Darwinianism we pictured our evolution as a simple procession
of forms leading from ape to man. Each age, as it
passed, transformed the men of the time one stage nearer to
us&mdash;one more distant from the ape. The true picture is very
different. We have to conceive an ancient world in which
the family of mankind was broken up into narrow groups or
genera, each genus again divided into a number of species&mdash;much
as we see in the monkey or ape world of to-day. Then
out of that great welter of forms one species became the
dominant form, and ultimately the sole surviving one&mdash;the
species represented by the modern races of mankind<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The first
Migrations.</div>

<p>We may assume therefore that the earth was mainly
peopled by the generalised pleistocene precursors, who moved
about, like the other migrating faunas, unconsciously,
everywhere following the lines of least
resistance, advancing or receding, and acting
generally on blind impulse rather than of any set purpose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>That such must have been the nature of the first migratory
movements will appear evident when we consider that they
were carried on by rude hordes, all very much alike, and
differing not greatly from other zoological groups, and further
that these migrations took place prior to the development of
all cultural appliances beyond the ability to wield a broken
branch or a sapling, or else chip or flake primitive stone
implements<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early Man and
his Works.</div>

<p>Herein lies the explanation of the curious phenomenon,
which was a stumbling-block to premature systematists, that
all the works of early man everywhere present
the most startling resemblances, affording absolutely
no elements for classification, for instance,
during the times corresponding with the Chellean or first
period of the Old Stone Age. The implements of palaeolithic
type so common in parts of South India, South Africa,
the Sudan, Egypt, etc., present a remarkable resemblance to one
another. This, while affording a <i>prima facies</i> case for, is not
conclusive of, the migrations of a definite type of humanity.</p>

<p>After referring to the identity of certain objects from the
Hastings kitchen-middens and a barrow near Sevenoaks,
W. J. L. Abbot proceeds: "The first thing that would strike
one in looking over a few trays of these implements is the
remarkable likeness which they bear to those of Dordogne.
Indeed many of the figures in the magnificent 'Reliquiae
Aquitanicae' might almost have been produced from these
specimens<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>." And Sir J. Evans, extending his glance over a
wider horizon, discovers implements in other distant lands
"so identical in form and character with British specimens
that they might have been manufactured by the same hands....
On the banks of the Nile, many hundreds of feet above its
present level, implements of the European types have been
discovered, while in Somaliland, in an ancient river valley, at
a great elevation above the sea, Seton-Karr has collected a
large number of implements formed of flint and quartzite,
which, judging from their form and character, might have
been dug out of the drift-deposits of the Somme and the
Seine, the Thames or the ancient
Solent<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>It was formerly held that man himself showed a similar
uniformity, and all palaeolithic skulls were referred to one
long-headed type, called, from the most famous example, the
Neandertal, which was regarded as having close affinities
with the present Australians. But this resemblance is shown
by Boule<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and others to be purely superficial, and recent
archaeological finds indicate that more than one racial type
was in existence in the Palaeolithic Age.</p>

<p>W. L. H. Duckworth on anatomical evidence
constructs the following table<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.</p>

<p>H. Obermaier<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> argues as follows: <i>Homo primigenius</i> is
neither the representative of an intermediate species between
ape and man, nor a lower or distinct type than <i>Homo sapiens</i>,
but an older primitive variety (race) of the latter, which
survives in exceptional cases down to the present day<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.
Clearly then, according to the rules of zoological classification,
we must term the two, <i>Homo sapiens var. primigenius</i>, as
compared with <i>Homo sapiens var. recens</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">H. primigenius,
Neandertal or
Mousterian
Man.</div>

<p>Whatever classification or nomenclature may be adopted
the dual division in palaeolithic times is now generally
recognised. The more primitive type is commonly
called Neandertal man, from the famous
cranium found in the Neandertal cave in 1857,
or Mousterian man, from the culture associations.
To this group belong the Gibraltar skull<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, and the
skeletons from Spy<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>, and Krapina, Croatia<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>, together with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the later discoveries (1908-11) at La Chapelle<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> (Corr&egrave;ze),

<div class="sidenote">H. recens, Galley

<p>Palaeolithic examples of the modern human type have
been found at Br&uuml;x (Bohemia)<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>, Br&uuml;nn (Moravia)<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and Galley

that at Combe Capelle in 1909<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. The numerous
skeletons found at Cro-Magnon<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and at the
Grottes de Grimaldi at Mentone<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> though showing certain
skeletal differences may be included in this group, the earliest
examples of which are associated with Aurignacian culture<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physical Types.</div>

<p>From the evidence contributed by these examples the
main characteristics of the two groups may be indicated,
although, owing to the imperfection of the
records, any generalisations must necessarily be
tentative and subject to criticism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Homo primigenius.</div>

<p>The La Chapelle skull recalls many of the primitive
features of the "ancestral types." The low receding forehead,
the overhanging brow-ridges, forming
continuous horizontal bars of bone overshadowing
the orbits, the inflated circumnasal region,
the enormous jaws, with massive ascending ramus, shallow
sigmoid notch, "negative" chin and other "simian" characters
seem reminiscent of <i>Pithecanthropus</i> and <i>Homo Heidelbergensis</i>.
The cranial capacity however is estimated at
over 1600 c.c., thus exceeding that of the average modern
European, and this development, even though associated, as
M. Boule has pointed out, with a comparatively lowly brain,
is of striking significance. The low stature, probably about
1600 mm. (under 5&frac12; feet) makes the size of the skull and
cranial capacity all the more remarkable. "A survey of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
characters of Neanderthal man&mdash;as manifested by his skeleton,
brain cast, and teeth&mdash;have convinced anthropologists of two
things: first, that we are dealing with a form of man totally
different from any form now living; and secondly, that the
kind of difference far exceeds that which separates the most
divergent of modern human races<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Homo recens.</div>

<p>The earliest complete and authentic example of "Aurignacian
man" was the skeleton discovered near Combe
Capelle (Dordogne) in 1909<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>. The stature is
low, not exceeding that of the Neandertal type,
but the limb bones are slighter and the build is altogether
lighter and more slender. The greatest contrast lies in the
skull. The forehead is vertical instead of receding, and the
strongly projecting brow-ridges are diminished, the jaw is
less massive and less simian with regard to all the features
mentioned above. Especially is this difference noticeable in
the projection of the chin, which now for the first time shows
the modern human outline. In short there are no salient
features which cannot be matched among the living races of
the present day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Human Culture.</div>

<p>On the cultural side no less than on the physical, the
thousands of years which the lowest estimate
attributes to the Early Stone Age were marked
by slow but continuous changes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reutelian, Mafflian,

<p>The Reutelian (at the junction of the Pliocene and
Pleistocene), Mafflian and Mesvinian industries,

the doubtful Eolithic Period, not yet generally
accepted<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strepyan.</div>

<p>The lowest palaeolithic deposit is the Strepyan, so called
from Str&eacute;py, near Charleroi, typically represented at St Acheul,
Amiens, and recognised also in the Thames
Valley<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. The tools exhibit deliberate flaking,
and mark the transition between eolithic and palaeolithic
work. The associated fauna includes two species of elephant,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
<i>E. meridionalis</i> and <i>E. antiquus</i>, two species of rhinoceros,
<i>R. Etruscus</i> and <i>R. Merckii</i>, and the hippopotamus. It is

to this stage.</p>

<p>The Chellean industry<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>, with the typical coarsely flaked
almond-shaped implements, occurs abundantly in the South of
England and in France, less commonly in Belgium,
Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia,
while examples have been recognised in Palestine, Egypt,
Somaliland, Cape Colony, Madras and other localities, though
outside Europe the date is not always ascertainable and the
form is not an absolute criterion<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Acheulean.</div>

<p>Acheulean types succeed apparently in direct descent but
the implements are altogether lighter, sharper, more efficient,
and are characterised by finer workmanship
and carefully retouched edges. A small finely
finished lanceolate implement is typical of the sub-industry
or local development at La Micoque (Dordogne).</p>

<p>The Chellean industry is associated with a warm climate
and the remains of <i>Elephas antiquus</i>, <i>Rhinoceros Merckii</i> and
hippopotamus. Lower Acheulean shows little variation, but
with Upper Acheulean certain animals indicating a colder
climate make their appearance, including the mammoth,
<i>Elephas primigenius</i>, and the woolly rhinoceros, <i>R. tichorhinus</i>,
but no reindeer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mousterian.</div>

<p>The Mousterian industry is entirely distinct from its
predecessors. The warm fauna has disappeared, the reindeer
first occurs together with the musk ox, arctic
fox, the marmot and other cold-loving animals.
Man appears to have sought refuge in the caves, and from
complete skeletons found in cave deposits of this stage we
gain the first clear ideas concerning the physical type of man
of the early palaeolithic period. Typical Mousterian implements
consist of leaf-like or triangular points made from
flakes struck from the nodule instead of from the dressed
nodule itself, as in the earlier stages. The Levallois flakes,
occurring at the base of the Mousterian (sometimes included
in the Acheulean stage), initiate this new style of workmanship,
but the Mousterian point shows an improvement in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
shape and a greater mastery in technique, producing a more
efficient tool for piercing and cutting. Scrapers, carefully
retouched, with a curved edge are also characteristic, besides
many other forms. The complete skeletons from Le Moustier
itself, La Chapelle, La Ferassie, and Krapina all belong to
this stage, which marks the end of the lower palaeolithic
period, the Age of the Mammoth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aurignacian.</div>

<p>The upper palaeolithic or Reindeer Age is divided into
Aurignacian, Solutrian, and Magdalenian<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> culture stages, with
the Azilian<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> separating the Magdalenian from
the neolithic period. Each stage is distinguished
by its implements and its art. The Aurignacian
fauna, though closely resembling the Mousterian, indicates an
amelioration of climate, the most abundant animals being the
bison, horse, cave lion, and cave hyena, and human settlements
are again found in the open. Among the typical
implements are finely worked knife-like blades (Ch&acirc;telperron
point, Gravette point), keeled scrapers (Tart&eacute; type), <i>burins</i>
or gravers, and various tools and ornaments of bone. Art is
represented by engravings and wall paintings, and to this
stage belong statuettes representing nude female figures such
as those of Brassempouy, Mentone, Pont-&agrave;-Lesse (Belgium),
Predmost and Willendorf, near Krems. The Neandertal
type appears to have died out and Aurignacian man belongs
to the modern type represented at Combe Capelle. If the
evidence of the figurines is to be accepted, a steatopygous
race was at this time in existence, which Sollas is inclined to
connect with the Bushmen<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Solutrian.</div>

<p>The Solutrian stage is characterised by the abundance of
the horse, replaced in the succeeding period by the reindeer.
The Solutrians seem to have been a warlike
steppe people who came from the east into
western Europe. Their subsequent fate has not been elucidated.
The culture appears to have had a limited range,
only a few stations being found outside Dordogne and the
neighbouring departments. The technique, as shown in the
laurel-leaf and willow-leaf points, exhibits a perfection of
workmanship unequalled in the Palaeolithic Age, and only
excelled by late prehistoric knives of Egypt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Magdalenian.</div>

<p>The rock shelter at La Madeleine has given its name to
the closing epoch of the Palaeolithic Age. The flint industry
shows distinct decadence, but the working in
bone and horn was at its zenith; indeed, so
marked is the contrast between this and the preceding stage
that Breuil is convinced that "the first Magdalenians were
not evolved from the Solutrians; they were new-comers in
our region<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>." The typical implements are barbed harpoons
in reindeer antler (later that of the stag), often decorated
with engravings. Sculpture and engravings of animals in
life-like attitudes are among the most remarkable records of
the age, and the polychrome pictures in the caves of Altamira,
"the Sistine chapel of Quaternary Art," are the admiration of
the world<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Azilian.</div>

<p>In the cave of Mas-d'Azil, between the Magdalenian and
Neolithic deposits occurs a stratum, termed Azilian, which, to
some extent, bridges over the obscure transition
between the Palaeolithic and Neolithic Ages.
The reindeer has disappeared, and its place is taken by the
stag. The realistic art of the Magdalenians is succeeded by
a more geometric style.  In flint working a return is made to
Aurignacian methods, and a particular development of pygmy
flints has received the name <i>Tardenoisian</i><a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.</p>

<p>The characteristic implement is still the harpoon, but it
differs in shape from the Magdalenian implement, owing to
the different structure of the material. Painted pebbles,
marked with red and black lines, in some cases suggesting a
script, have given rise to much controversy. Their meaning
at present remains obscure<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chronology.</div>

<p>The question of prehistoric chronology is a difficult one,
and the more cautious authorities do not commit themselves
to dates. Of late years, however, such researches
as those of A. Penck and E. Br&uuml;ckner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
in the Alps<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and of Baron de Geer and W. C. Br&oslash;gger in
Sweden<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>, have provided a sound basis for calculations. Penck
recognises four periods of glaciation during the pleistocene
period, which he has named after typical areas, the G&uuml;nz,
Mindel, Riss and W&uuml;rm. He dates the W&uuml;rm maximum at
between 30,000 and 50,000 years ago and estimates the
duration of the Riss-W&uuml;rm interglacial period at about
100,000 years. According to his calculations the Chellean
industry occurs in the Mindel-Riss, or even in the G&uuml;nz-Mindel
interval, but it is more commonly placed in the mild
phase intervening before the last (W&uuml;rm) glaciation, this
latter corresponding with the cold Mousterian stage. At
least four subsequent oscillations of climate have been recognised
by Penck, the Achen, B&uuml;hl, Gschnitz and Daun, and
the correspondence of these with palaeolithic culture stages
may be seen in the following table<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 1024px;">
<img src="images/illus-026.jpg" width="1024" height="512" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>James Geikie<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>, under the heading, "Reliable and Unreliable
estimates of geological time," points out that the
absolute duration of the Pleistocene cannot be determined,
but such investigations as those of Penck "enable us to form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
some conception of the time involved." He accepts as a
rough approximation Penck's opinion that "the Glacial period
with all its climatic changes may have extended over half a
million years, and as the Chellean stage dates back to at least
the middle of the period, this would give somewhere between
250,000 and 500,000 years for the antiquity of man in Europe.
But if, as recent discoveries would seem to indicate, man was
an occupant of our Continent during the First Interglacial
epoch, if not in still earlier times, we may be compelled
greatly to increase our estimate of his antiquity" (p. 303).</p>

<p>W. J. Sollas, on the other hand, is content with a far more
contracted measure. Basing his calculations mainly on the
investigations of de Geer, he concludes that the interval that
separates our time from the beginning of the end of the last
glacial episode is 17,000 years. He places the Azilian age at
5500 <small>B.C.</small>, the middle of the Magdalenian age somewhere
about 8000 <small>B.C.</small>, Mousterian 15,000 <small>B.C.</small>, and the close of the
Chellean 25,000 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>But when all the changes in climate are taken into consideration,
the periods of elevation and depression of the
land, the transformations of the animals, the evolution of
man, the gradual stages of advance in human culture, the development
of the races of mankind, and their distribution over
the surface of the globe, this estimate is regarded by many
as insufficient. Allen Sturge claims "scores of thousands of
years" for the neolithic period alone<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>, and Sir W. Turner
points out the very remote times to which the appearance of
neolithic man must be assigned in Scotland. After showing
that there is undoubted evidence of the presence of man in
North Britain during the formation of the Carse clays, this
careful observer explains that the Carse cliffs, now in places
45 to 50 feet above the present sea-level, formed the bed of
an estuary or arm of the sea, which in post-glacial times
extended almost, if not quite across the land from east to
west, thus separating the region south of the Forth from
North Britain. He even suggests, after the separation of
Britain from the Continent in earlier times, another land
connection, a "Neolithic land-bridge" by which the men of
the New Stone Age may have reached Scotland when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
upheaved 100-foot terrace was still clothed with the great
forest growths that have since disappeared<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.</p>

<p>One begins to ask, Are even 100,000 years sufficient for
such oscillations of the surface, upheaval of marine beds,
appearance of great estuaries, renewed connection of Britain
with the Continent by a "Neolithic land-bridge"? In the
Falkirk district neolithic kitchen-middens occur on, or at the
base of, the bluffs which overlook the Carse lands, that is, the
old sea-coast. In the Carse of Gowrie also a dug-out canoe
was found at the very base of the deposits, and immediately
above the buried forest-bed of the Tay Valley<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.</p>

<p>That the neolithic period was also of long duration even
in Scandinavia has been made evident by Carl Wibling, who
calculates that the geological changes on the south-east coast
of Sweden (Province of Bleking), since its first occupation
by the men of the New Stone Age, must have required a
period of "at least 10,000 years<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>."</p>

<p>Still more startling are the results of the protracted researches
carried on by J. N&uuml;esch at the now famous station
of Schweizersbild, near Schaffhausen in Switzerland<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. This
station was apparently in the continuous occupation of man
during both Stone Ages, and here have been collected as
many as 14,000 objects belonging to the first, and over 6000
referred to the second period. Although the early settlement
was only post-glacial, a point about which there is no room
for doubt, L. Laloy<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> has estimated "the absolute duration of
both epochs together at from 24,000 to 29,000 years." We
may, therefore, ask, If a comparatively recent post-glacial
station in Switzerland is about 29,000 years old, how old may
a pre- or inter-glacial station be in Gaul or Britain?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The early
History of
Man a Geological
Problem.</div>

<p>From all this we see how fully justified is J. W. Powell's
remark that the natural history of early man becomes more
and more a geological, and not merely an ethnological
problem<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>. We also begin to understand
how it is that, after an existence of some five
score millenniums, the first specialised human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
varieties have diverged greatly from the original types, which
have thus become almost "ideal quantities," the subjects
rather of palaeontological than of strictly anthropological
studies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Human
Varieties the
Outcome of
their several
Environments.</div>

<p>And here another consideration of great moment presents
itself. During these long ages some of the groups&mdash;most
African negroes south of the equator, most
Oceanic negroes (Negritoes and Papuans), and
Australian and American aborigines&mdash;have remained
in their original habitats ever since what
may be called the first settlement of the earth
by man. Others again, the more restless or enterprising
peoples, such as the Mongols, Manchus, Turks, Ugro-Finns,
Arabs, and most Europeans, have no doubt moved about
somewhat freely; but these later migrations, whether hostile
or peaceable, have for the most part been confined to regions
presenting the same or like physical and climatic conditions.
Wherever different climatic zones have been invaded, the
intruders have failed to secure a permanent footing, either
perishing outright, or disappearing by absorption or more or
less complete assimilation to the aboriginal elements. Such
are some "black Arabs" in Egyptian Sudan, other Semites
and Hamites in Abyssinia and West Sudan (Himyarites,
Fulahs and others), Finns and Turks in Hungary and the
Balkan Peninsula (Magyars, Bulgars, Osmanli), Portuguese
and Netherlanders in Malaysia, English in tropical or sub-tropical
lands, such as India, where Eurasian half-breeds alone
are capable of founding family groups.</p>

<p>The human varieties are thus seen to be, like all other
zoological species, the outcome of their several environments.
They are what climate, soil, diet, pursuits and inherited
characters have made them, so that all sudden transitions are
usually followed by disastrous results<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. "To urge the emigration
of women and children, or of any save those of the
most robust health, to the tropics, may not be to murder in
the first degree, but it should be classed, to put it mildly, as
incitement to it<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>." Acclimatisation may not be impossible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
but in all extreme cases it can be effected only at great
sacrifice of life, and by slow processes, the most effective of
which is perhaps Natural Selection. By this means we may
indeed suppose the world to have been first peopled.</p>

<p>At the same time it should be remembered that we know
little of the climatic conditions at the time of the first migrations,
though it has been assumed that it was everywhere
much milder than at present. Consequently the different
zones of temperature were less marked, and the passage from
one region to another more easily effected than in later times.
In a word the pleistocene precursors had far less difficulty in
adapting themselves to their new surroundings than modern
peoples have when they emigrate, for instance, from Southern
Europe to Brazil and Paraguay, or from the British Isles to
Rhodesia and Nyassaland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Correspondence
of Geographical
with Racial and
Cultural Zones.</div>

<p>What is true of man must be no less true of his works;
from which it follows that racial and cultural zones correspond
in the main with zones of temperature, except
so far as the latter may be modified by altitude,
marine influences, or other local conditions. A
glance at past and existing relations the world
over will show that such harmonies have at all times prevailed.
No doubt the overflow of the leading European peoples during
the last 400 years has brought about divers dislocations,
blurrings, and in places even total effacements of the old
landmarks.</p>

<p>But, putting aside these disturbances, it will be found that
in the Eastern hemisphere the inter-tropical regions, hot, moist
and more favourable to vegetable than to animal vitality, are
usually occupied by savage, cultureless populations. Within
the same sphere are also comprised most of the extra-tropical
southern lands, all tapering towards the antarctic waters,
isolated, and otherwise unsuitable for areas of higher
specialisation.</p>

<p>Similarly the sub-tropical Asiatic peninsulas, the bleak
Tibetan tableland, the Pamir, and arid Mongolian steppes are
found mainly in possession of somewhat stationary communities,
which present every stage between sheer savagery
and civilisation.</p>

<p>In the same way the higher races and cultures are confined
to the more favoured north temperate zone, so that between
the parallels of 24&deg; and 50&deg; (but owing to local conditions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
falling in the far East to 40&deg; and under, and in the extreme
West rising to 55&deg;) are situated nearly all the great centres,
past and present, of human activities&mdash;the Egyptian, Babylonian,
Minoan (Aegean), Hellenic, Etruscan, Roman, and
modern European. Almost the only exceptions are the
early civilisations (Himyaritic) of Yemen (Arabia Felix) and
Abyssinia, where the low latitude is neutralised by altitude
and a copious rainfall.</p>

<p>Thanks also to altitude, to marine influences, and the
contraction of the equatorial lands, the relations are almost
completely reversed in the New World. Here all the higher
developments took place, not in the temperate but in the
tropical zone, within which lay the seats of the Peruvian,
Chimu, Chibcha and Maya-Quich&eacute; cultures; the Aztec
sphere alone ranged northwards a little beyond the Tropic
of Cancer.</p>

<p>Thus in both hemispheres the iso-cultural bands follow
the isothermal lines in all their deflections, and the human
varieties everywhere faithfully reflect the conditions of their
several environments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progress of
Archaeological
Studies.</div>

<p>If, as above seen, the study of human origins is largely
a geological problem, the investigation of the later developments,
during the Metal Ages and prehistoric
times, belongs mainly to the field of Archaeology.
Hence it is that for the light which has in recent
years been thrown upon the obscure interval between the
Stone Ages and the strictly historic epoch, that is to say, the
period when in his continuous upward development man
gradually exchanged stone for the more serviceable metals,
we are indebted chiefly to the pioneer labours of such men
as Worsaae, Steenstrup, Forchhammer, Schliemann, Sayce,
Layard, Lepsius, Mariette, Maspero, Montelius, Brugsch,
Petrie, Peters, Haynes, Sir J. Evans, Sir A. J. Evans and
many others, all archaeologists first, and anthropologists only
in the second instance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sequence of the
Metal Ages.</div>

<p>From the researches of these investigators it is now clear
that copper, bronze, and iron were successively in use in
Europe in the order named, so that the current
expressions, "Copper," "Bronze," and "Iron"
Ages remain still justified. But it also appears
that overlappings, already beginning in late Neolithic times,
were everywhere so frequent that in many localities it is quite
impossible to draw any well-marked dividing lines between
the successive metal periods.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>That iron came last, a fact already known by vague
tradition to the ancients<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>, is beyond doubt, and it is no less
certain that bronze of various types intervened between copper
and iron. But much obscurity still surrounds the question of
copper, which occurs in so many graves of Neolithic and
Bronze times, that this metal has even been denied an independent
position in the sequence.</p>

<p>But we shall not be surprised that confusion should prevail
on this point, if we reflect that the metals, unlike stone, came
to remain. Once introduced they were soon found to be
indispensable to civilised man, so that in a sense the "Metal
Ages" still survive, and must last to the end of time. Hence
it was natural that copper should be found in prehistoric
graves associated, first with polished stone implements, and
then with bronze and iron, just as, since the arrival of the
English in Australia, spoons, clay pipes, penknives, pannikins,
and the like, are now found mingled with stone objects in the
graves of the aborigines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Copper
Age.</div>

<p>But that there was a true Copper Age<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> prior to that of
Bronze, though possibly of not very long duration, except
of course in the New World<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>, has been placed
beyond reasonable doubt by recent investigations.
Considerable attention was devoted to the
subject by J. H. Gladstone, who finds that copper was worked
by the Egyptians in the Sinaitic Peninsula, that is, in the
famous mines of the Wadi Magh&aacute;ra, from the fourth to the
eighteenth dynasty, perhaps from 3000 to 1580 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> During
that epoch tools were made of pure copper in Egypt and
Syria, and by the Amorites in Palestine, often on the model
of their stone prototypes<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Egypt.</div>

<p>Elliot Smith<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> claims that "the full story of the coming of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>copper, complete in every detail and circumstance, written in
a simple and convincing fashion that he who runs
may read," has been displayed in Egypt ever
since the year 1894, though the full significance of the evidence
was not recognised until Reisner called attention to
the record of pre-dynastic graves in Upper Egypt when
superintending the excavations at Naga-ed-d&ecirc;r in 1908<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>.
These excavations revealed the indigenous civilisation of the
ancient Egyptians and, according to Elliot Smith, dispose of
the idea hitherto held by most archaeologists that Egypt
owed her knowledge of metals to Babylonia or some other
Asiatic source, where copper, and possibly also bronze, may
be traced back to the fourth millennium <small>B.C.</small> There was
doubtless intercourse between the civilisations of Egypt and
Babylonia but "Reisner has revealed the complete absence
of any evidence to show or even to suggest that the language,
the mode of writing, the knowledge of copper ... were imported"
(p. 34). Elliot Smith justly claims (p. 6) that in no
other country has a similarly complete history of the discovery
and the evolution of the working of copper been revealed, but
until equally exhaustive excavations have been undertaken on
contemporary or earlier sites in Sumer and Elam, the question
cannot be regarded as settled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Elam.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Babylonia.</div>

<p>The work of J. de Morgan at Susa<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> (1907-8) shows the
extreme antiquity of the Copper Age in ancient Elam, even if
his estimate of 5000 <small>B.C.</small> is regarded as a millennium
too early<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>. At the base of the mound on
the natural soil, beneath 24 meters of archaeological layers,
were the remains of a town and a necropolis consisting
of about 1000 tombs. Those of the men contained copper
axes of primitive type; those of the women, little vases of
paint, together with discs of polished copper to serve as
mirrors. At Fara, excavations by Koldewey in 1902, and by
Andrae and N&ouml;ldeke in 1903 on the site of Shuruppak (the
home of the Babylonian Noah) in the valley of
the Lower Euphrates, revealed graves attributed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
to the prehistoric Sumerians, containing copper spear heads,
axes and drinking vessels<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Europe.</div>

<p>In Europe, North Italy, Hungary and Ireland<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> may lay
claim to a Copper Age, but there is very little evidence of
such a stage in Britain. To this period also
may be attributed the nest or <i>cache</i> of pure
copper ingots found at Tourc'h, west of the Aven Valley,
Finisterre, described by M. de Villiers du Terrage, and comprising
23 pieces, with a total weight of nearly 50 lbs.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> These
objects, which belong to "the transitional period when copper
was used at first concurrently with polished stone, and then
disappeared as bronze came into more general use<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>," came
probably from Hungary, at that time apparently the chief
source of this metal for most parts of Europe. Of over 200
copper objects described by Mathaeus Much<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> nearly all were
of Hungarian or South German <i>provenance</i>, five only being
accredited to Britain and eight to France.</p>

<p>The study of this subject has been greatly advanced by
J. Hampel, who holds on solid grounds that in some regions,
especially Hungary, copper played a dominant part for many
centuries, and is undoubtedly the characteristic metal of a
distinct culture. His conclusions are based on the study of
about 500 copper objects found in Hungary and preserved in
the Buda Pesth collections. Reviewing all the facts attesting
a Copper Age in Central Europe, Egypt, Italy, Cyprus, Troy,
Scandinavia, North Asia, and other lands, he concludes that
a Copper Age may have sprung up independently wherever
the ore was found, as in the Ural and Altai Mountains, Italy,
Spain, Britain, Cyprus, Sinai; such culture being generally
indigenous, and giving evidence of more or less characteristic
local features<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>. In fact we know for certain that such an
independent Copper Age was developed not only in the
region of the Great Lakes of North America, but also
amongst the Bantu peoples of Katanga and other parts of
Central Africa. Copper is not an alloy like bronze, but a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
soft, easily-worked metal occurring in large quantities and in
a tolerably pure state near the surface in many parts of the
world. The wonder is, not that it should have been found
and worked at a somewhat remote epoch in several different
centres, but that its use should have been so soon superseded
in so many places by the bronze alloys.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bronze
Age.</div>

<p>From copper to bronze, however, the passage was slow
and progressive, the proper proportion of tin, which was
probably preceded in some places by an alloy of
antimony, having been apparently arrived at by
repeated experiments often carried out with no
little skill by those prehistoric metallurgists.</p>

<p>As suggested by Bibra in 1869, the ores of different
metals would appear to have been at first smelted together
empirically, and the process continued until satisfactory results
were obtained. Hence the extraordinary number of metals,
of which percentages are found in some of the earlier specimens,
such as those of the Elbing Museum, which on analysis
yielded tin, lead, silver, iron, antimony, arsenic, sulphur, nickel,
cobalt, and zinc in varying quantities<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Egypt and
Babylonia.</div>

<p>Some bronzes from the pyramid of Medum analysed by
J. H. Gladstone<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> yielded the high percentage of 9.1 of tin,
from which we must infer, not only that bronze, but bronze of
the finest quality, was already known to the Egyptians of the
fourth dynasty, <i>i.e.</i> 2840 <small>B.C.</small> The statuette of Gudea of
Lagash (2500 <small>B.C.</small>) claimed as the earliest example of bronze
in Babylonia is now known to be pure copper, and though
objects from Tello (Lagash) of earlier date contain
a mixture of tin, zinc, arsenic and other
alloys, the proportion is insignificant. The
question of priority must, however, be left open until the
relative chronology of Egypt and Babylonia is finally settled,
and this is still a much disputed point<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>. Neither would all
the difficulties with regard to the origin of bronze be cleared
up should Egypt or Babylonia establish her claim to possess
the earliest example of the metal, for neither country appears<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
to possess any tin. The nearest deposit known in ancient
times would seem to be that of Drangiana, mentioned by
Strabo, identified with modern Khorassan<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Western
Europe.</div>

<p>Strabo and other classical writers also mention the occurrence
of tin in the west, in Spain, Portugal and the Cassiterides
or tin islands, whose identity has given rise to so
much speculation<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>, but "though in after times
Egypt drew her tin from Europe it would be
bold indeed to suppose that she did so [in 3000 <small>B.C.</small>] and still
bolder to maintain that she learned from northern people how
to make the alloy called bronze<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>." Apart from the indigenous
Egyptian origin maintained by Elliot Smith (above) the
hypothesis offering fewest difficulties is that the earliest
bronze is to be traced to the region of Elam, and that the
knowledge spread from S. Chaldaea (Elam-Sumer) to S.
Egypt in the third millennium <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Aegean.</div>

<p>There seems to be little doubt that the Aegean was the
centre of dispersal for the new metals throughout the Mediterranean
area, and copper ingots have been
found at various points of the Mediterranean,
marked with Cretan signs<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>. Bronze was known in Crete
before 2000 <small>B.C.</small> for a bronze dagger and spear head were
found at Hagios Onuphrios, near Phaistos, with seals resembling
those of the sixth to eleventh dynasties<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>.</p>

<p>From the eastern Mediterranean the knowledge spread
during the second millennium along the ordinary trade routes
which had long been in use. The mineral ores of Spain were
exploited in pre-Mycenean times and probably contributed in
no small measure to the industrial development of southern
Europe. From tribe to tribe, along the Atlantic coasts the
traffic in minerals reached the British Isles, where the rich
ores were discovered which, in their turn, supplied the markets
of the north, the west and the south.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Ireland.</b></div>

<p>Even Ireland was not left untouched by Aegean influence,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
which reached it, according to G. Coffey<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>, by way of the
Danube and the Elbe, and thence by way of
Scandinavia, though this is a matter on which
there is much difference of opinion. Ireland's richness in
gold during the Bronze Age made her "a kind of El Dorado
of the western world," and the discovery of a gold torc found
by Schliemann in the royal treasury in the second city of
Troy raises the question as to whether the model of the torc
was imported into Ireland from the south<a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>, or whether (which
J. D&eacute;chelette<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> regards as less probable) there was already an
exportation of Irish gold to the eastern Mediterranean in pre-Mycenean
times.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Chronology of
the Copper and

<p>Of recent years great strides have been made towards
the establishment of a definite chronology linking the historic
with the prehistoric periods in the Aegean, in

of various authorities differ sometimes by a
thousand years or so, the subjoined table will be of use to

the dates are in all cases merely approximate.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>The Iron Age.</b></div>

<p>It has often been pointed out that there is no reason why
iron should not have been the earliest metal to be used by
man. Its ores are more abundant and more
easily reduced than any others, and are worked
by peoples in a low grade of culture at the present day<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>.
Iron may have been known in Egypt almost as early as
bronze, for a piece in the British Museum is attributed to the
fourth dynasty, and some beads of manufactured iron were
found in a pre-dynastic grave at El Gerzeh<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>. But these and
other less well authenticated occurrences of iron are rare, and
the metal was not common in Egypt before the middle of the
second millennium. By the end of the second millennium the
knowledge had spread throughout the eastern Mediterranean<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>,
and towards 900 at latest iron was in common use in Italy

<div class="sidenote">Hallstatt.</div>

<p>The introduction of iron into Italy has often been attributed
to the Etruscans, who were thought to have brought
the knowledge from Lydia. But the most abundant remains
of the Early Iron Age are found not in Tuscany, but along
the coasts of the Adriatic<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>, showing that iron followed the
well-known route of the amber trade, thus reaching Central
Europe and <i>Hallstatt</i> (which has given its name to the Early
Iron Age), where alone in Europe the gradual transition
from the use of bronze to that of iron has been clearly traced.
W. Ridgeway<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> believes that the use of iron was first discovered
in the Hallstatt area and that thence it spread to
Switzerland, France, Spain, Italy, Greece, the Aegean area,
and Egypt rather than that the culture drift was in the
opposite direction. There is no difference of opinion however
as to the importance of this Central European area
which contained the most famous iron mines of antiquity.
Hallstatt culture extended from the Iberian
peninsula in the west to Hungary in the east,
but scarcely reached Scandinavia, North Germany, Armorica
or the British Isles where the Bronze Age may be said to
have lasted down to about 500 <small>B.C.</small> Over such a vast domain
the culture was not everywhere of a uniform type and
Hoernes<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> recognises four geographical divisions distinguished
mainly by pottery and fibulae, and provisionally classified as
Illyrian in the South West, or Adriatic region, in touch with
Greece and Italy; Celtic in the Central or Danubian area;
with an off-shoot in Western Germany, Northern Switzerland
and Eastern France; and Germanic in parts of Germany,
Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia and Posen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>La T&egrave;ne.</b></div>

<p>The Hallstatt period ends, roughly, at 500 <small>B.C.</small>, and the
Later Iron Age takes its name from the settlement of <i>La
T&egrave;ne</i>, in a bay of the Lake of Neuch&acirc;tel in
Switzerland. This culture, while owing much
to that of Hallstatt, and much also to foreign sources, possesses
a distinct individuality, and though soon overpowered
on the Continent by Roman influence, attained a remarkable
brilliance in the Late Celtic period in the British Isles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Man and his
Works in the
Metal Ages.</div>

<p>That the peoples of the Metal Ages were physically well
developed, and in a great part of Europe and Asia already of
Aryan speech, there can be no reasonable doubt.
A skull of the early Hallstatt period, from a
grave near Wildenroth, Upper Bavaria, is described
by Virchow as long-headed, with a cranial capacity of
no less than 1585 c.c., strongly developed occiput, very high
and narrow face and nose, and in every respect a superb
specimen of the regular-featured, long-headed North European<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>.
But owing to the prevalence of cremation the
evidence of race is inadequate. The Hallstatt population
was undoubtedly mixed, and at Glasinatz in Bosnia, another
site of Hallstatt civilisation, about a quarter of the skulls
examined were brachycephalic<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>.</p>

<p>Their works, found in great abundance in the graves,
especially of the Bronze and Iron periods, but a detailed
account of which belongs to the province of archaeology,
interest us in many ways. The painted earthenware vases
and incised metal-ware of all kinds enable the student to
follow the progress of the arts of design and ornamentation
in their upward development from the first tentative efforts
of the prehistoric artist at pleasing effects. Human and
animal figures, though rarely depicted, occasionally afford a
curious insight into the customs and fashions of the times.
On a clay vessel, found in 1896 at Lahse in Posen, is figured
a regular hunting scene, where we see men mounted on
horseback, or else on foot, armed with bow and arrow, pursuing
the quarry (nobly-antlered stags), and returning to the
penthouse after the chase<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. The drawing is extremely primitive,
but on that account all the more instructive, showing in
connection with analogous representations on contemporary
objects, how in prehistoric art such figures tend to become
conventionalised and purely ornamental, as in similar designs
on the vases and textiles from the Ancon Necropolis, Peru.
"Most ornaments of primitive peoples, although to our eye
they may seem merely geometrical and freely-invented
designs, are in reality nothing more than degraded animal
and human figures<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>This may perhaps be the reason why so many of the
drawings of the metal period appear so inferior to those of
the cave-dwellers and of the present Bushmen. They are
often mere conventionalised reductions of pictorial prototypes,
comparable, for instance, to the characters of our alphabets,
which are known to be degraded forms of earlier pictographs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Prehistoric
Age in the
West,</div>

<p>Of the so-called "Prehistoric Age" it is obvious that no
strict definition can be given. It comprises in a general way
that vague period prior to all written records,
dim memories of which&mdash;popular myths, folklore,
demi-gods<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>, eponymous heroes<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>, traditions
of real events<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>&mdash;lingered on far into historic times, and
supplied ready to hand the copious materials afterwards
worked up by the early poets, founders of new religions, and
later legislators.</p>

<p>That letters themselves, although not brought into general
use, had already been invented, is evident from the mere fact
that all memory of their introduction beyond the vaguest
traditions had died out before the dawn of history. The
works of man, while in themselves necessarily continuous,
stretched back to such an inconceivably remote past, that
even the great landmarks in the evolution of human progress
had long been forgotten by later generations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and in China.</div>

<p>And so it was everywhere, in the New World as in the
Old, amongst Eastern as amongst Western Peoples. In the
Chinese records the "Age of the Five Emperors"&mdash;five,
though nine are named&mdash;answers
somewhat to our prehistoric epoch. It had its eponymous
hero, Fu Hi, reputed founder of the empire, who invented
nets and snares for fishing and hunting, and taught his people
how to rear domestic animals. To him also is ascribed the
institution of marriage, and in his time Tsong Chi is supposed
to have invented the Chinese characters, symbols, not of
sounds, but of objects and ideas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came other benevolent rulers, who taught the people
agriculture, established markets for the sale of farm produce,
discovered the medicinal properties of plants, wrote treatises
on diseases and their remedies, studied astrology and astronomy,
and appointed "the Five Observers of the heavenly
bodies."</p>

<p>But this epoch had been preceded by the "Age of the
Three [six] Rulers," when people lived in caves, ate wild
fruits and uncooked food, drank the blood of animals and
wore the skins of wild beasts (our Old Stone Age). Later
they grew less rude, learned to obtain fire by friction, and
built themselves habitations of wood or foliage (our Early
Neolithic Age). Thus is everywhere revealed the background
of sheer savagery, which lies behind all human
culture, while the "Golden Age" of the poets fades with the
"Hesperides" and Plato's "Atlantis" into the region of the
fabulous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Historic Times.</div>

<p>Little need here be said of strictly historic times, the most
characteristic feature of which is perhaps the general use of
letters. By means of this most fruitful of
human inventions, everything worth preserving
was perpetuated, and thus all useful knowledge tended to
become accumulative. It is no longer possible to say when
or where the miracle was wrought by which the apparently
multifarious sounds of fully-developed languages were exhaustively
analysed and effectively expressed by a score or
so of arbitrary signs. But a comparative study of the various
writing-systems in use in different parts of the world has
revealed the process by which the transition was gradually
brought about from rude pictorial representations of objects
to purely phonetical symbols.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evolution of
Writing
Systems.</div>

<p>As is clearly shown by the "winter counts" of the North
American aborigines, and by the prehistoric rock carvings in
Upper Egypt, the first step was a <i>pictograph</i>,
the actual figure, say, of a man, standing for a
given man, and then for any man or human
being. Then this figure, more or less reduced or conventionalised,
served to indicate not only the term <i>man</i>, but the
full sound <i>man</i>, as in the word <i>manifest</i>, and in the modern
rebus. At this stage it becomes a <i>phonogram</i>, or <i>phonoglyph</i>,
which, when further reduced beyond all recognition of its
original form, may stand for the syllable <i>ma</i> as in <i>ma-ny</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
without any further reference either to the idea or the sound
man. The phonogram has now become the symbol of a
monosyllable, which is normally made up of two elements, a
consonant and a vowel, as in the Devan&aacute;gari, and other
syllabic systems.</p>

<p>Lastly, by dropping the second or vowel element the
same symbol, further modified or not, becomes a <i>letter</i> representing
the sound <i>m</i>, that is, one of the few ultimate elements
of articulate speech. A more or less complete set of such
characters, thus worn down in form and meaning, will then
be available for indicating more or less completely all the
phonetic elements of any given language. It will be a true
<i>alphabet</i>, the wonderful nature of which may be inferred from
the fact that only two, or possibly three, such alphabetic
systems are known with absolute certainty to have ever been
independently evolved by human ingenuity<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>. From the above
exposition we see how inevitably the Phoenician parent of
nearly all late alphabets expressed at first the consonantal
sounds only, so that the vowels or vowel marks are in all
cases later developments, as in Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, Greek,
the Italic group, and the Runes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hieroglyphs
and Cuneiforms.</div>

<p>In primitive systems, such as the Egyptian, Sumerian,
Chinese, Maya-Quich&eacute; and Mexican, one or more of the
various transitional steps may be developed and used simultaneously,
with a constant tendency to advance on the lines
above indicated, by gradual substitution of the later for the
earlier stages. A comparison of the Sumerian
cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphic systems
brings out some curious results. Thus at an
extremely remote epoch, some millenniums ago, the Sumerians
had already got rid of the pictorial, and to a great extent of
the ideographic, but had barely reached the alphabetic phase.
Consequently their cuneiform groups, although possessing
phonetic value, mainly express full syllables, scarcely ever
letters, and rarely complete words. Ideographs had given
place first to phonograms and then to mere syllables,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
"complex syllables in which several consonants may be
distinguished, or simple syllables composed of only one consonant
and one vowel or <i>vice versa</i><a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>."</p>

<p>The Egyptians, on the other hand, carried the system
right through the whole gamut from pictures to letters, but
retained all the intermediate phases, the initial tending to fall
away, the final to expand, while the bulk of the hieroglyphs
represented in various degrees the several transitional states.
In many cases they "had kept only one part of the syllable,
namely a mute consonant; they detached, for instance, the
final <i>u</i> from <i>bu</i> and <i>pu</i>, and gave only the values <i>b</i> and <i>p</i> to
the human leg

<p>In the process of evolution, metaphor and analogy of
course played a large part, as in the evolution of language
itself. Thus a lion might stand both for the animal and for
courage, and so on. The first essays in phonetics took somewhat
the form of a modern rebus, thus:
<img src="images/sievesym.png" width="32" height="32"  alt="sieve symbol" title="sieve symbol" /> = <i>khau</i> = sieve,
<img src="images/matsym.png" width="30" height="40"  alt="mat symbol" title="mat symbol" /> = <i>pu</i> = mat;
<img src="images/mouthsym.png" width="65" height="35"  alt="mouth symbol" title="mouth symbol" /> = <i>ru</i> = mouth, whence
<img src="images/khopiru.png" width="66" height="58"  alt="to be" title="to be" /> = <i>kho-pi-ru</i> = to be,
where the sounds and not the meaning of the several
components are alone attended to<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Alphabet.</div>

<p>By analogous processes was formed a true alphabet, in
which, however, each of the phonetic elements was represented
at first by several different characters
derived from several different words having the
same initial syllable. Here was, therefore, an <i>embarras de
richesses</i>, which could be got rid of only by a judicious process
of elimination, that is, by discarding all like-sounding symbols
but one for the same sound. When this final process of
reduction was completed by the scribes, in other words, when
all the phonetic signs were rejected except 23, <i>i.e.</i> one for
each of the 23 phonetic elements, the Phoenician alphabet as
we now have it was completed. Such may be taken as the real
origin of this system, whether the scribes in question were
Babylonians, Egyptians, Minaeans, or Europeans, that is,
whether the Phoenician alphabet had a cuneiform, a hieroglyphic,
a South Arabian, a Cretan (Aegean), Ligurian or
Iberian origin, for all these and perhaps other peoples have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
been credited with the invention. The time is not yet ripe
for deciding between these rival claimants<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Persian
and other
Cuneiform
Scripts.</div>

<p>But whatever be the source of the Phoenician, that of
the Persian system current under the Achaemenides is clear
enough. It is a true alphabet of 37 characters,
derived by some selective process directly from
the Babylonian cuneiforms, without any attempt
at a modification of their shapes. Hence
although simple compared with its prototype, it is clumsy
enough compared with the Phoenician script, several of the
letters requiring groups of as many as four or even five
"wedges" for their expression. None of the other cuneiform
systems also derived from the Sumerian (the Assyrian,
Elamite, Vannic, Medic) appear to have reached the pure
alphabetic state, all being still encumbered with numerous
complex syllabic characters. The subjoined table, for which
I have to thank T. G. Pinches, will help to show the genesis
of the cuneiform combinations from the earliest known pictographs.
These pictographs themselves are already reduced
to the merest outlines of the original pictorial representations.
But no earlier forms, showing the gradual transition from the
primitive picture writing to the degraded pictographs here
given, have yet come to light<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mas-d'Azil
Markings.</div>

<p>Here it may be asked, What is to be thought of the
already-mentioned pebble-markings from the Mas-d'Azil
Cave at the close of the Old Stone Age? If
they are truly phonetic, then we must suppose
that palaeolithic man not only invented an
alphabetic writing system, but did this right off by intuition,
as it were, without any previous knowledge of letters. At
least no one will suggest that the Dordogne cave-dwellers
were already in possession of pictographic or other crude
systems, from which the Mas-d'Azil "script" might have
been slowly evolved. Yet E. Piette, who groups these
pebbles, painted with peroxide of iron, in the four categories
of numerals, symbols, pictographs, and alphabetical characters,
states, in reference to these last, that 13 out of 23 Phoenician
characters were equally Azilian graphic signs. He even
suggests that there may be an approach to an inscription in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
one group, where, however, the mark indicating a stop
implies a script running Semitic-fashion from right to left,
whereas the letters themselves seem to face the other way<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>.
G. G. MacCurdy<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>, who accepts the evidence for the existence
of writing in Azilian, if not in Magdalenian times, notes the
close similarity between palaeolithic signs and Phoenician,
ancient Greek and Cypriote letters. But
J. D&eacute;chelette<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
reviewing (pp. 234, 236) the arguments against Piette's claims,
points out in conclusion (p. 320) the impossibility of admitting
that the population of Gaul could suddenly lose so beneficial
a discovery as that of writing. Yet thousands of years elapse
before the earliest appearance of epigraphic monuments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alphabetiform
Signs on
Neolithic
Monuments.</div>

<p>A possible connection has been suggested by Sergi
between the Mas-d'Azil signs and the markings that have
been discovered on the megalithic monuments
of North Africa, Brittany, and the British Isles.
These are all so rudimentary that resemblances
are inevitable, and of themselves afford little
ground for necessary connections. Primitive man is but a
child, and all children bawl and scrawl much in the same way.
Nevertheless C. Letourneau<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> has taken the trouble to compare
five such scrawls from "Libyan inscriptions" now in
the Bardo Museum, Tunis, with similar or identical signs on
Brittany and Irish dolmens. There is the familiar circle plain and dotted
<img src="images/circles.png" width="65" height="30"  title="plain and dotted circles" alt="plain and dotted circles" />,
the cross in its simplest form <big>+</big>, the pothook and segmented square
<img src="images/segsq.png" width="65" height="30"  alt="pothook and segmented square" title="pothook and segmented square" />,
all of which recur in
the Phoenician, Keltiberian, Etruscan, Libyan or Tuareg
systems. Letourneau, however, who does not call them
letters but only "signes alphab&eacute;tiformes," merely suggests
that, if not phonetic marks when first carved on the neolithic
monuments, they may have become so in later times. Against
this it need only be urged that in later times all these peoples
were supplied with complete alphabetic systems from the
East as soon as they required them. By that time all the
peoples of the culture-zone were well-advanced into the
historic period, and had long forgotten the rude carvings of
their neolithic forefathers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character and
Consequences
of the later
(historical)
Migrations.</div>

<p>Armed with a nearly perfect writing system, and the
correlated cultural appliances, the higher races soon took a
foremost place in the general progress of mankind, and
gradually acquired a marked ascendancy, not only over the
less cultured populations of the globe, but in
large measure over the forces of nature herself.
With the development of navigation and improved
methods of locomotion, inland seas,
barren wastes, and mountain ranges ceased to
be insurmountable obstacles to their movements, which within<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
certain limits have never been arrested throughout all recorded
time.</p>

<p>Thus, during the long ages following the first peopling of
the earth by pleistocene man, fresh settlements and readjustments
have been continually in progress, although wholesale
displacements must be regarded as rare events. With few
exceptions, the later migrations, whether hostile or peaceful,
were, for reasons already stated<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>, generally of a partial
character, while certain insular regions, such as America and
Australia, remained little affected by such movements till
quite recent times. But for the inhabitants of the eastern
hemisphere the results were none the less far-reaching. Continuous
infiltrations could not fail ultimately to bring about
great modifications of early types, while the ever-active
principle of convergence tended to produce a general uniformity
amongst the new amalgams. Thus the great varietal
divisions, though undergoing slow changes from age to age,
continued, like all other zoological groups, to maintain a
distinct regional character.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The "Race"
merges in the
"People."</div>

<p>Flinders Petrie has acutely observed that the only meaning
the term "race" now can have is that of a group of human
beings, whose type has become unified by their
rate of assimilation exceeding the rate of change
produced by foreign elements<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>. We are also
reminded by Gustavo Tosti that "in the actual state of science
the word 'race' is a vague formula, to which nothing definite
may be found to correspond. On the one hand, the original
races can only be said to belong to palaeontology, while the
more limited groups, now called races, are nothing but peoples,
or societies of peoples, brethren by civilization more than by
blood. The race thus conceived ends by identifying itself
with nationality<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>." Hence it has been asked why, on the
principle of convergence, a fusion of various races, if isolated
long enough in a given area, may not eventually lead to a
new racial type, without leaving any trace of its manifold
origin<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>.</p>

<p>Such new racial types would be normal for the later
varietal groups, just as the old types were normal for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
earlier groups, and a general application might be given to
Topinard's famous dictum that <i>les peuples seuls sont des
r&eacute;alit&eacute;s</i><a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>, that is, peoples alone&mdash;groups occupying definite
geographical areas&mdash;have an objective existence. Thus, the
notion of race, as a zoological expression in the sense of a
pure breed or strain, falls still more into the background, and,
as Virchow aptly remarks, "this term, which always implied
something vague, has in recent times become in the highest
degree uncertain<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The distinguishing
Characters
of Peoples.</div>

<p>Hence Ehrenreich treats the present populations of the
earth rather as zoological groups which have been developed
in their several geographical domains, and are
to be distinguished not so much by their bony
structure as by their external characters, such as
hair, colour, and expression, and by their habitats and languages.
None of these factors can be overlooked, but it would seem
that the character of the hair forms the most satisfactory
basis for a classification of mankind, and this has therefore
been adopted for the new edition of the present work. It
has the advantage of simplicity, without involving, or even
implying, any particular theory of racial or geographical
origins. It has stood the test of time, being proposed by
Bory de Saint Vincent in 1827, and adopted by Huxley,
Haeckel, Broca, Topinard and many others.</p>

<p>The three main varieties of hair are the <i>straight</i>, the <i>wavy</i>
and the so-called <i>woolly</i>, termed respectively <i>Leiotrichous</i>,
<i>Cymotrichous</i> and <i>Ulotrichous</i><a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>. Straight hair usually falls
straight down, though it may curl at the ends, it is generally
coarse and stiff, and is circular in section. Wavy hair is
undulating, forming long curves or imperfect spirals, or closer
rings or curls, and the section is more or less elliptical.
Woolly hair is characterised by numerous, close, often interlocking
spirals, 1-9 mm. in diameter, the section giving the
form of a lengthened ellipse. Straight hair is usually the
longest, and woolly hair the shortest, wavy hair occupying an
intermediate position.</p>

suggests that these traders were already acquainted with the metal in S. Arabia in
the fourth millennium, and that it was through them that a piece found its way
into Egypt in the fourth dynasty. "Die Erfinder des Eisentechnik," <i>Zeitschrift f.

adds another Sothic period (1461 years, calculated from Sothis or Sirius), thus
throwing the earlier dynasties a millennium or two further back. Dynasty I,

<div class="sidenote">The Negro-Caucasic
"Great Divide."</div>

<p>From the anthropological standpoint Africa falls into two
distinct sections, where the highest (Caucasic) and the lowest
(Negro) divisions of mankind have been conterminous
throughout all known time. Mutual
encroachments and interpenetrations have probably
been continuous, and indeed are still going on. Yet so
marked is the difference between the two groups, and such is
the tenacity with which each clings to its proper domain, that,
despite any very distinct geographical frontiers, the ethnological
parting line may still be detected. Obliterated at one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
or two points, and at others set back always in favour of the
higher division, it may be followed from the Atlantic coast
along the course of the Senegal river east by north to the
great bend of the Niger at Timbuktu; then east by south to
Lake Chad, beyond which it runs nearly due east to Khartum,
at the confluence of the White and Blue Niles.</p>

<p>From this point the now isolated Negro groups (Bas&eacute; and
Barea), on the northern slope of the Abyssinian plateau, show
that the original boundary was at first continued still east to
the Red Sea at or about Massowa. But for many ages the
line appears to have been deflected from Khartum along the
White Nile south to the Sobat confluence, then continuously
south-eastwards round by the Sobat Valley to the Albert
Nyanza, up the Somerset Nile to the Victoria Nyanza, and
thence with a considerable southern bend round Masailand
eastwards to the Indian Ocean at the equator.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Negro
Domain.</div>

<p>All the land north of this irregular line belongs to the
Hamito-Semitic section of the Caucasic division, all south of it
to the western (African) section of the Ulotrichous
division. Throughout this region&mdash;which comprises
the whole of Sudan from the Atlantic to
the White Nile, and all south of Sudan except Abyssinia,
Galla, Somali and Masai lands&mdash;the African Negro, clearly,
distinguished from the other main groups by the above summarised
physical<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and mental qualities, largely predominates
everywhere and in many places exclusively. The route by
which he probably reached these intertropical lands, where he
may be regarded as practically indigenous, has been indicated
in <i>Ethnology</i>, Chs. X. and XI.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Negro Origins.</div>

<p>As regards the date of this occupation, nothing can be
clearly proved. "The history of Africa reaches back but a
short distance, except, of course, as far as the
lower Nile Valley and Roman Africa is concerned;
elsewhere no records exist, save tribal traditions, and
these only relate to very recent events. Even archaeology,
which can often sketch the main outlines of a people's history,
is here practically powerless, owing to the insufficiency of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
data. It is true that stone implements of palaeolithic and
neolithic types are found sporadically in the Nile Valley<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>,
Somaliland, on the Zambesi, in Cape Colony and the northern
portions of the Congo Free State, as well as in Algeria and
Tunisia; but the localities are far too few and too widely
separated to warrant the inference that they are to be in any
way connected. Moreover, where stone implements are
found they are, as a rule, very near, even actually on, the
surface of the earth," and they are rarely, if ever, found in
association with bones of extinct animals. "Nothing occurs
resembling the regular stratification of Europe, and consequently
no argument based on geological grounds is possible<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>."
The exceptions are the lower Nile and Zambesi where true
palaeoliths have been found not only on the surface (which in
this case is not inconsistent with great antiquity) but also in
stratified gravel. Implements of palaeolithic <i>type</i> are doubtless
common, and may be compared to Chellean, Mousterian
and even Solutrian specimens<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>, but primitive culture is not
necessarily pleistocene. Ancient forms persisted in Egypt
down to the historic period, and even patination is no sure
test of age, so until further evidence is found the antiquity of
man in Africa must remain undecided<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>.</p>

<p>Yet since some remote if undated epoch the specialised
Negro type, as depicted on the Egyptian monuments some
thousands of years ago<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>, has everywhere been
maintained with striking uniformity. "Within
this wide domain of the black Negro there is a
remarkably general similarity of type.... If you took a Negro
from the Gold Coast of West Africa and passed him off
amongst a number of Nyasa natives, and if he were not
remarkably distinguished from them by dress or tribal marks,
it would not be easy to pick him out<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two Main
Sections: Sudanese
and
Bantus.</div>

<p>Nevertheless considerable differences are perceptible to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>the practised eye, and the contrasts are sufficiently marked
to justify ethnologists in treating the <i>Sudanese</i>
and the <i>Bantu</i> as two distinct subdivisions of
the family. In both groups the relatively full-blood
natives are everywhere very much alike,
and the contrasts are presented chiefly amongst the mixed or
Negroid populations. In Sudan the disturbing elements are
both Hamitic (Berbers and Tuaregs) and Semitic (Arabs);
while in Bantuland they are mainly Hamitic (Galla) in all the
central and southern districts, and Arabs on the eastern seaboard
from the equator to Sofala beyond the Zambesi. To
the varying proportions of these several ingredients may
perhaps be traced the often very marked differences observable
on the one hand between such Sudanese peoples as the Wolof,
Mandingans, Hausa, Nubians, Zandeh<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>, and Mangbattu, and
on the other between all these and the Swahili, Baganda,
Zulu-Xosa, Be-Chuana, Ova-Herero and some other Negroid
Bantu.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contrasts and
Analogies.</div>

<p>But the distinction is based on social, linguistic, and
cultural, as well as on physical grounds, so that, as at present
constituted, the Sudanese and Bantu really constitute two
tolerably well-defined branches of the Negro
family. Thanks to Muhammadan influences,
the former have attained a much higher level of
culture. They cultivate not only the alimentary but also the
economic plants, such as cotton and indigo; they build stone
dwellings, walled towns, substantial mosques and minarets;
they have founded powerful states, such as those of the
Hausa and Songhai, of Ghana and Bornu, with written
records going back a thousand years, although these historical
peoples are all without exception half-breeds, often with more
Semitic and Hamitic than Negro blood in their veins.</p>

<p>No such cultured peoples are anywhere to be found in
Bantuland except on the east coast, where the "Moors"
founded great cities and flourishing marts centuries before the
appearance of the Portuguese in the eastern seas. Among
the results of the gold trade with these coastal settlements
may be classed the Zimbabwe monuments and other ruins
explored by Theodore Bent in the mining districts south of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the Zambesi. But in all the Negro lands free from foreign
influences no true culture has ever been developed, and here
cannibalism, witchcraft, and sanguinary "customs" are often
still rife, or have been but recently suppressed by the direct
action of European administrations.</p>

<p>Numberless authorities have described the Negro as unprogressive,
or, if left to himself, incapable of progress in his
present physical environment. Sir H. H. Johnston, who
knows him well, goes much further, and speaks of him as a
fine animal, who, "in his wild state, exhibits a stunted mind
and a dull content with his surroundings, which induces
mental stagnation, cessation of all upward progress, and even
retrogression towards the brute. In some respects I think
the tendency of the Negro for several centuries past has been
an actual retrograde one<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sudanese
and Bantu
Linguistic
Areas.</div>

<p>There is one point in which the Bantu somewhat unaccountably
compare favourably with the Sudanese.  In all
other regions the spread of culture has tended
to bring about linguistic unity, as we see in the
Hellenic world, where all the old idioms were
gradually absorbed in the "common dialect" of
the Byzantine empire, again in the Roman empire, where
Latin became the universal speech of the West, and lastly in
the Muhammadan countries, where most of the local tongues
have nearly everywhere, except in Sudan, disappeared before
the Arabic, Persian, and Turkish languages.</p>

<p>But in Negroland the case is reversed, and here the less
cultured Bantu populations all, without any known exception,
speak dialects of a single mother-tongue, while the greatest
linguistic confusion prevails amongst the semi-civilised as well
as the savage peoples of Sudan.</p>

<p>Although the Bantu language may, as some suppose<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>, have
originated in the north and spread southwards to the Congo,
Zambesi, and Limpopo basins, it cannot now be even remotely
affiliated to any one of the numerous distinct forms of speech
current in the Sudanese domain. Hence to allow time for its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
diffusion over half the continent, the initial movement must
be assigned to an extremely remote epoch, and a corresponding
period of great duration must be postulated for the profound
linguistic disintegration that is everywhere witnessed in the
region between the Atlantic and Abyssinia. Here agglutination,
both with prefixed and postfixed particles, is the
prevailing morphological order, as in the Mandingan, Fulah,
Nubian, Dinkan, and Mangbattu groups. But every shade
of transition is also presented between true agglutination and
inflection of the Hamito-Semitic types, as in Hausa, Kanuri,
Kanem, Dasa or Southern and Teda or Northern Tibu<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, and especially in Upper Guinea, the originally
agglutinating tongues have developed on lines analogous to
those followed by Tibetan, Burmese, Chinese, and Otomi in
other continents, with corresponding results. Thus the Tshi,
Ewe, and Yoruba, surviving members of a now extinct stock-language,
formerly diffused over the whole region between
Cape Palmas and the Niger Delta, have become so burdened
with monosyllabic homophones (like-sounding monosyllables),
that to indicate their different meanings several distinguishing
tones have been evolved, exactly as in the Indo-Chinese
group. In Ewe (Slave Coast) the root <i>do</i>, according as it is
toned may mean to put, let go, tell, kick, be sad, join, change,
grow big, sleep, prick, or grind. So great are the ravages
of phonetic decay, that new expedients have been developed
to express quite simple ideas, as in Tshi (Gold Coast) <i>addanmu</i>,
room (<i>addan</i> house, <i>mu</i> interior); <i>akwancherifo</i>, a guide
(<i>akwan</i> road, <i>cheri</i> to show, <i>fo</i> person); <i>ensahtsiabah</i>, finger
(<i>ensah</i> hand, <i>tsia</i> small, <i>abbah</i> child = hand's-little-child); but
middle-finger = "hand's-little-chief" (<i>ensahtsiahin</i>, where <i>ehin</i>
chief takes the place of <i>abbah</i> child<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The "Drum
Language."</div>

<p>Common both to Sudanese and Bantus, especially about
the western borderlands (Upper Guinea, Cameruns, etc.) is
the "drum-language," which affords a striking
illustration of the Negro's musical faculty.
"Two or three drums are usually used together,
each producing a different note, and they are played either
with the fingers or with two sticks. The lookers-on generally
beat time by clapping the hands. To a European, whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
ear and mind are untrained for this special faculty, the rhythm
of a drum expresses nothing beyond a repetition of the same
note at different intervals of time; but to a native it expresses
much more. To him the drum can and does speak, the
sounds produced from it forming words, and the whole
measure or rhythm a sentence. In this way, when company
drums are being played at an <i>ehs&aacute;du</i> [palaver], they are made
to express and convey to the bystanders a variety of meanings.
In one measure they abuse the men of another company,
stigmatising them as fools and cowards; then the rhythm
changes, and the gallant deeds of their own company are
extolled. All this, and much more, is conveyed by the beating
of drums, and the native ear and mind, trained to select
and interpret each beat, is never at fault. The language of
drums is as well understood as that which they use in their
daily life. Each chief has his own call or motto, sounded by
a particular beat of his drums. Those of Amankwa Tia, the
Ashanti general who fought against us in the war of 1873-4,
used to say <i>P&#301;r&#301;h&#363;h</i>, hasten. Similar mottoes are also expressed
by means of horns, and an entire stranger in the
locality can at once translate the rhythm into words<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>."</p>

<p>Similar contrasts and analogies will receive due illustration
in the detailed account here following of the several more
representative Sudanese groups.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">West Sudanese.</span></h3>

<p><i>Wolofs.</i> Throughout its middle and lower course the
Senegal river, which takes its name from the Zenaga Berbers,
forms the ethnical "divide" between the Hamites and the
Sudanese Negroes. The latter are here represented by the
Wolofs, who with the kindred <i>Jolofs</i> and <i>Serers</i> occupy an
extensive territory between the Senegal and the Gambia
rivers. Whether the term "Wolof" means "Talkers," as if
they alone were gifted with the faculty of speech, or "Blacks"
in contrast to the neighbouring "Red" Fulahs, both interpretations
are fully justified by these Senegambians, at once the
very blackest and amongst the most garrulous tribes in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
whole of Africa. The colour is called "ebony," and they are
commonly spoken of as "Blacks of the Black." They are
also very tall even for Negroes, and the Serers especially
may claim to be "the Patagonians of the Old World," men six
feet six inches high and proportionately muscular being far
from rare in the coast districts about St Louis and Dakar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Primitive
Wolof Speech.</div>

<p>Their language, which is widespread throughout Senegambia,
may be taken as a typical Sudanese form of speech,
unlike any other in its peculiar agglutinative
structure, and unaffected even in its vocabulary
by the Hamitic which has been current for ages
on the opposite bank of the Senegal. A remarkable feature
is the so-called "article," always postfixed and subject to a
two-fold series of modifications, first in accordance with the
initial consonant of the noun, for which there are six possible
consonantal changes (<i>w</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>g</i>), and then according as
the object is present, near, not near, and distant, for which
there are again four possible vowel changes (<i>i</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>a</i>), or
twenty-four altogether, a tremendous redundancy of useless
variants as compared with the single English form <i>the</i>. Thus
this Protean particle begins with <i>b</i>, <i>d</i> or <i>w</i> to agree with <i>b&aacute;ye</i>,
father, <i>digene</i>, woman, or <i>fos</i>, horse, and then becomes <i>bi</i>, <i>bu</i>,
<i>bo</i>, <i>ba</i>; <i>di</i>, <i>du</i> etc.; <i>wi</i>, <i>wu</i> etc. to express the presence and
the varying distances of these objects: <i>b&aacute;ye-bi</i> = father-the-here;
<i>b&aacute;ye-bu</i> = father-the-there; <i>b&aacute;ye-bo</i> = father-the-yonder;
<i>b&aacute;ye-b&aacute;</i> = father-the-away in the distance.</p>

<p>All this is curious enough; but the important point is that
it probably gives us the clue to the enigmatic alliterative
system of the Bantu languages as explained in <i>Ethnology</i>,
p. 273, the position of course being reversed. Thus as in
Zulu <i>in</i>- kose requires <i>en</i>- kulu, so in Wolof <i>baye</i> requires <i>bi</i>,
<i>di</i>gene <i>di</i>, and so on. There are other indications that the
now perfected Bantu grew out of analogous but less developed
processes still prevalent in the Sudanese tongues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Primitive
Wolof Pottery.</div>

<p>Equally undeveloped is the Wolof process of making
earthenware, as observed by M. F. Regnault amongst the
natives brought to Paris for the Exhibition of
1895. He noticed how one of the women
utilised a somewhat deep bowl resting on the
ground in such a way as to be easily spun round by the hand,
thus illustrating the transition between hand-made and turned
pottery. Kneading a lump of clay, and thrusting it into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
bowl, after sprinkling the sides with some black dust to
prevent sticking, she made a hollow in the mass, enlarging
and pressing it against the bowl with the back of the fingers
bent in, the hand being all the time kept in a vertical position.
At the same time the bowl was spun round with the left
palm, this movement combined with the pressure exerted by
the right hand causing the sides of the vessel to rise and take
shape. When high enough it was finished off by thickening
the clay to make a rim. This was held in the right hand and
made fast to the mouth of the vessel by the friction caused
by again turning the bowl with the left hand. This transitional
process is frequently met with in Africa<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious
Notions.</div>

<p>Most of the Wolofs profess themselves Muhammadans,
the rest Catholics, while all alike are heathen at heart; only
the former have charms with texts from the
Koran which they cannot read, and the latter
medals and scapulars of the "Seven Dolours"
or of the Trinity, which they cannot understand. Many old
rites still flourish, the household gods are not forgotten, and
for the lizard, most popular of tutelar deities, the customary
milk-bowl is daily replenished. Glimpses are thus afforded
of the totemic system which still survives in a modified form
amongst the Be-Chuana, the Mandingans, and several other
African peoples, but has elsewhere mostly died out in Negroland.
The infantile ideas associated with plant and animal
totem tokens have been left far behind, when a people like
the Serers have arrived at such a lofty conception as Takhar,
god of justice, or even the more materialistic Tiurakh, god
of wealth, although the latter may still be appealed to for
success in nefarious projects which he himself might scarcely
be expected to countenance. But the harmony between
religious and ethical thought has scarcely yet been reached
even amongst some of the higher races.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mandingan
Groups,
Culture and
Industries.</div>

<p><i>Mandingans.</i> In the whole of Sudan there is scarcely a
more numerous or widespread people than the Mandingans,
who&mdash;with their endless ramifications, <i>Kassonk&eacute;</i>,
<i>Jallonk&eacute;</i>, <i>Sonink&eacute;</i>, <i>Bambara</i>, <i>Vei</i> and many
others&mdash;occupy most of the region between the
Atlantic and the Joliba (Upper Niger) basin, as
far south as about 9&deg; N. latitude. Within these limits it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
often difficult to say who are, or who are not members of this
great family, whose various branches present all the transitional
shades of physical type and culture grades between the true
pagan Negro and the Muhammadan Negroid Sudanese.</p>

<p>Even linguistic unity exists only to a limited extent, as
the numerous dialects of the Mand&eacute; stock-language have
often diverged so greatly as to constitute independent tongues
quite unintelligible to the neighbouring tribes. The typical
Mandingans, however&mdash;Faidherbe's Malinka-Sonink&eacute; group&mdash;may
be distinguished from the surrounding populations by
their more softened features, broader forehead, larger nose,
fuller beard, and lighter colour. They are also distinguished
by their industrious habits and generally higher culture, being
rivalled by few as skilled tillers of the soil, weavers, and
workers in iron and copper. They thus hold much the same
social position in the west that the Hausa do in the central
region beyond the Niger, and the French authorities think
that "they are destined to take a position of ever increasing
importance in the pacified Sudan of the future<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>."</p>

<p>Thus history brings about its revenges, for the Mandingans
proper of the Kong plateau may fairly claim, despite
their late servitude to the Fulah conquerors and their present
ready acceptance of French rule, to be a historical people
with a not inglorious record of over 1000 years, as founders
of the two great empires of Melle and Guin&eacute;, and of the
more recent states of Moasina, Bambara, Kaarta, Kong, and
others about the water-parting between the head-streams of
the Niger, and the rivers flowing south to the Gulf of Guinea.
Here is the district of Manding, which is the original home
of the <i>Manding'k&eacute;</i>, <i>i.e.</i> "People of Manding," as they are
generally called, although <i>Mand&eacute;</i> appears to be the form
used by themselves<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>.  Here also was the famous city of Mali<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
or Melle, from which the Upper Niger group take the name
of <i>Mali'nk&eacute;</i>, in contradistinction to the <i>Soni'nk&eacute;</i> of the Senegal
river, the <i>Jalo'nk&eacute;</i> of Futa-Jallon, and the <i>Bamana</i> of Bambara,
these being the more important historical and cultured
groups.</p>

<div class="sidenote">History.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Guin&eacute; and
Mali Empires.</div>

<p>According to native tradition and the annals of Ahmed
B&aacute;b&aacute;, rescued from oblivion by Barth<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>, the first Mandingan
state of Guin&eacute; (Gh&aacute;na, Gh&aacute;nata), a name still
surviving in the vague geographical term
"Guinea," goes back to pre-Muhammadan times. Wakayamangha,
its legendary founder, is supposed to
have flourished 300 years before the Hejira, at
which date twenty-two kings had already reigned.
Sixty years after that time the Moslem Arabs or Berbers are
said to have already reached West Sudan, where they had
twelve mosques in Gh&aacute;na, first capital of the empire, and
their chief stronghold till the foundation of Jinni on the
Upper Niger (1043 <small>A.D.</small>).</p>

<p>Two centuries later (1235-60) the centre of the Mandingan
rule was transferred to Mali, which under the great king
Mansa-Musa (1311-31) became the most powerful Sudanese
state of which there is any authentic record. For a time it
included nearly the whole of West Sudan, and a great part
of the western Sahara, beside the Songhai State with its
capital Gogo, and Timbuktu. Mansa-Musa, who, in the
language of the chronicler, "wielded a power without measure
or limits," entered into friendly relations with the emperor of
Morocco, and made a famous pilgrimage to Mecca, the
splendours of which still linger in the memory of the Mussulman
populations through whose lands the interminable
procession wound its way. He headed 60,000 men of arms,
says Ahmed B&aacute;b&aacute;, and wherever he passed he was preceded
by 500 slaves, each bearing a gold stick weighing 500 mitkals
(14 lbs.), the whole representing a money value of about
&pound;4,000,000 (?). The people of Cairo and Mecca were
dazzled by his wealth and munificence; but during the
journey a great part of his followers were seized by a painful
malady called in their language <i>tuat</i>, and this word still lives
in the Oasis of Tuat, where most of them perished.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>Even after the capture of Timbuktu by the Tuaregs
(1433), Mali long continued to be the chief state in West
Nigritia, and carried on a flourishing trade, especially in slaves
and gold. But this gold was still supposed to come from the
earlier kingdom of Guin&eacute;, which word consequently still
remains associated with the precious metal in the popular
belief. About the year 1500 Mali was captured by the
Songhai king, Omar Askia, after which the empire fell to
pieces, and its memory now survives only in the ethnical term
<i>Mali'nk&eacute;</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contrasts
between the
Inland and
Coast Peoples.</div>

<p><i>Felups.</i> From the semi-civilised Muhammadan negroid
Mandingans to the utterly savage full-blood Negro Felups
the transition is abrupt, but instructive. In
other regions the heterogeneous ethnical groups
crowded into upland valleys, as in the Caucasus,
have been called the "sweepings of the plains."
But in West Sudan there are no great ranges towering above
the lowlands, and even the "Kong Mountains" of school
geographies have now been wiped out by L. G. Binger<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>.
Hence the rude aborigines of the inland plateau, retreating
before the steady advance of Islam, found no place of refuge
till they reached the indented fjord-like Atlantic seaboard,
where many still hold their ground. This is the explanation
of the striking contrasts now witnessed between the interior
and so many parts of the West Coast; on the one hand
powerful political organisations with numerous, more or less
homogeneous, and semi-civilised negroid populations, on the
other an infinite tangle of ethnical and linguistic groups, all
alike weltering in the sheerest savagery, or in grades of
barbarism even worse than the wild state.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Felup Type
and Mental
Characters.</div>

<p>Even the <i>Felups</i>, whose territory now stretches from the
Gambia to the Cacheo, but formerly reached the Geba and
the Bissagos Islands, do not form a single group.
Originally the name of an obscure coast-tribe,
the term Felup or Fulup has been extended by
the Portuguese traders to all the surrounding peoples&mdash;<i>Ayamats</i>,
<i>Jolas</i>, <i>Jig&uacute;shes</i>, <i>Vacas</i>, <i>Joats</i>, <i>Karons</i>, <i>Bany&uacute;ns</i>,
<i>Banjars</i>, <i>Ful&uacute;ns</i>, <i>Bayots</i> and some others who amid much
local diversity, presented a sufficiently general outward resemblance
to be regarded as a single people by the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
European settlers. The Felups proper display the physical
and mental characters of the typical Negro even in an exaggerated
form&mdash;black colour, flat nose, wide nostrils, very
thick and everted lips, red on the inner surface, stout
muscular frame, correlated with coarse animal passions, crass
ignorance, no arts, industry, or even tribal organisation, so that
every little family group is independent and mostly in a state
of constant feud with its neighbours. All go naked, armed
with bow and arrow, and live in log huts which, though
strongly built, are indescribably filthy<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>.</p>

<p>Mother-right frequently prevails, rank and property being
transmitted in the female line. There is some notion of a
superhuman being vaguely identified with the sky, the rain,
wind or thunderstorm. But all live in extreme terror of the
medicine-man, who is openly courted, but inwardly detested,
so that whenever it can be safely done the tables are turned,
the witch-doctor is seized and tortured to death.</p>

<p><i>Timni, Kru, Sierra-Leonese, Liberians.</i> Somewhat
similar conditions prevail all along the seaboard from Sierra
Leone to, and beyond, Cape Palmas, disturbed or modified
by the Liberian intruders from the North American plantations,
and by the slaves rescued in the thirties and forties by
the British cruisers and brought to Sierra Leone, where their
descendants now live in settled communities under European
influences. These "coloured" citizens of Sierra Leone and
Liberia, who are so often the butt of cheap ridicule, and are
themselves perhaps too apt to scorn the kindred "niggers"
of the bush, have to be carefully distinguished from these true
aborigines who have never been wrenched from their natural
environment.</p>

<p>In Sierra Leone the chief aboriginal groups on the coastlands
are the <i>Timni</i> of the Rokelle river, flanked north and
south by two branches of the <i>Bulams</i>, and still further south the
<i>Gallinas</i>, <i>Veys</i> and <i>Golas</i>; in the interior the <i>Lokkos</i>, <i>Limbas</i>,
<i>Konos</i>, and <i>Kussas</i>, with <i>Kurankos</i>, <i>Mendis</i>, <i>Hubus</i>, and other
Mandingans and Fulahs everywhere in the Hinterland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Timni Beliefs.</div>

<p>Of all these the most powerful during the British occupation
have always been the Timni (Timani, Temn&eacute;), who sold
to the English the peninsula on which now
stands Freetown, but afterwards crying off the
bargain, repeatedly tried to drive the white and coloured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
intruders into the sea. They are a robust people of softened
Negro type, and more industrious farmers than most of the
other natives. Like the Wolofs they believe in the virtue
both of Christian and Moslem amulets, but have hitherto lent
a deaf ear to the preachers of both these religions. Nevertheless
the Protestant missionaries have carefully studied the
Timni language, which possesses an oral literature rich in
legends, proverbs, and folklore<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">West African

and language. It presents curious points of
analogy with the brotherhoods of the Micronesian islanders,
but appears to be even more potent for good and evil, a
veritable religious and political state within the state. "When
their mandates are issued all wars and civil strife must cease,
a general truce is established, and bloodshed stopped, offending
communities being punished by bands of armed men in
masks. Strangers cannot enter the country unless escorted
by a member of the guild, who is recognised by passwords,
symbolic gestures, and the like. Their secret rites are celebrated
at night in the depths of the forest, all intruders being
put to death or sold as slaves<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sierra
Leonese.</div>

<p>In studying the social conditions prevalent amongst the
Sierra Leonese proper, it should be remembered that they
are sprung, not only from representatives of
almost every tribe along the seaboard, and even
in the far interior, but also to a large extent from
the freedmen and runaways of Nova Scotia and London,
besides many maroons of Jamaica, who were settled here
under the auspices of the Sierra Leone Company towards
the close of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth
century. Others also have in recent years been attracted to
the settlements from the Timni and other tribes of the neighbouring
districts. The Sierra Leonese are consequently not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
themselves a tribe, nor yet a people, but rather a people in
course of formation under the influence of a new environment
and of a higher culture. An immediate consequence of such
a sudden aggregation of discordant elements was the loss of
all the native tongues, and the substitution of English as the
common medium of intercourse. But English is the language
of a people standing on the very highest plane of culture, and
could not therefore be properly assimilated by the <i>disjecta
membra</i> of tribes at the lowest rung of the social ladder.
The resultant form of speech may be called ludicrous, so
ludicrous that the Sierra Leonese version of the New Testament
had to be withdrawn from circulation as verging almost
on the blasphemous<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Social
Relations.</div>

<p>It has also to be considered that all the old tribal relations
were broken up, while an attempt was made to merge these
waifs and strays in a single community based
on social conditions to which each and all were
utter strangers. It is not therefore surprising
that the experiment has not proved a complete success, and
that the social relations in Sierra Leone leave something to
be desired. Although the freedmen and the rescued captives
received free gifts of land, their dislike for the labours of the
field induced many to abandon their holdings, and take to
huckstering and other more pleasant pursuits. Hence their
descendants almost monopolise the petty traffic and even the
"professions" in Freetown and the other colonial settlements.
Although accused of laziness and dishonesty, they
have displayed a considerable degree of industrial as well as
commercial enterprise, and the Sierra Leone craftsmen&mdash;smiths,
mechanics, carpenters, builders&mdash;enjoy a good reputation
in all the coast towns. All are Christians of various
denominations, and even show a marked predilection for the
"ministry." Yet below the surface the old paganism still
slumbers, and vodoo practices, as in the West Indies and
some of the Southern States, are still heard of.</p>

<p>Morality also is admittedly at a low ebb, and it is curious
to note that this has in part been attributed to the freedom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
enjoyed under the British administration. "They have
passed from the sphere of native law to that of British law,
which is brought to this young community like an article of
ready-made clothing. Is it a wonder that the clothes do not
fit? Is it a wonder that kings and chiefs around Sierra
Leone, instead of wishing their people to come and see how
well we do things, dread for them to come to this colony on
account of the danger to their morals? In passing into this
colony, they pass into a liberty which to them is license<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Liberians.</div>

<p>An experiment of a somewhat different order, but with
much the same negative results, has been tried by the well-meaning
founders of the Republic of Liberia.
Here also the bulk of the "civilised aristocrats"
are descended of emancipated plantation slaves, a first consignment
of whom was brought over by a philanthropic
American society in 1820-22. The idea was to start them
well in life under the fostering care of their white guardians,
and then leave them to work out their own redemption in
their own way. All control was accordingly withdrawn in
1848, and since then the settlement has constituted an absolutely
independent Negro state in the enjoyment of complete
self-government. Progress of a certain material kind was
undoubtedly made. The original "free citizens" increased
from 8000 in 1850 to perhaps 20,000 in 1898<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>, and the central
administration, modelled on that of the United States, maintained
some degree of order among the surrounding aborigines,
estimated at some two million within the limits of the
Republic.</p>

<p>But these aborigines have not benefited perceptibly by
contact with their "civilised" neighbours, who themselves
stand at much the same level intellectually and morally as
their repatriated forefathers. Instead of attending to the
proper administration of the Republic, the "Weegee," as
they are called, have constituted themselves into two factions,
the "coloured" or half-breeds, and the full-blood Negroes who,
like the "Blancos" and "Neros" of some South American
States, spend most of their time in a perpetual struggle for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
office. All are of course intensely patriotic, but their
patriotism takes a wrong direction, being chiefly manifested
in their insolence towards the English and other European
traders on the coast, and in their supreme contempt for
the "stinking bush-niggers," as they call the surrounding
aborigines. In 1909 internal and external difficulties led to
the appointment of a Commission by President Roosevelt
with the result that the American Government took charge
of the finances, military organisation, agriculture and boundary
questions, besides arranging for a loan of &pound;400,000. The
able administration of President Barclay, a pure blooded
Negro, though not of Liberian ancestry, is perhaps the
happiest augury for the future of the Republic<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Krumen.</div>

<p>The <i>Krus</i> (Kroomen, Krooboys<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>), whose numerous hamlets
are scattered along the coast from below Monrovia nearly to
Cape Palmas, are assuredly one of the most
interesting people in the whole of Africa.
Originally from the interior, they have developed in their
new homes a most un-African love of the sea, hence are
regularly engaged as crews by the European skippers plying
along those insalubrious coastlands.</p>

<p>In this service, in which they are known by such nicknames
as "Bottle-of-Beer," "Mashed-Potatoes," "Bubble-and-Squeak,"
"Pipe-of-Tobacco," and the like, their word
may always be depended upon. But it is to be feared that
this loyalty, which with them is a strict matter of business,
has earned for them a reputation for other virtues to which
they have little claim. Despite the many years that they
have been in the closest contact with the missionaries and
traders, they are still at heart the same brutal savages as
ever. After each voyage they return to the native village to
spend all their gains and pilferings in drunken orgies, and
relapse generally into sheer barbarism till the next steamer
rounds the neighbouring headland. "It is not a comfortable
reflection," writes Bishop Ingham, whose testimony will not
be suspected of bias, "as we look at this mob on our decks,
that, if the ship chance to strike on a sunken rock and
become unmanageable, they would rise to a man, and seize
all they could lay hands on, cut the very rings off our fingers if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
they could get them in no other way, and generally loot the
ship. Little has been done to Christianise these interesting,
hard-working, cheerful, but ignorant and greedy people, who
have so long hung on the skirts of civilisation<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>."</p>

<p>It is only fair to the Kru to say that this unflattering
picture of them stands alone. "There is but one man of all
of us who have visited West Africa who has not paid a
tribute to the Kruboy's sterling qualities," says Miss Kingsley.
Her opinion coincides with that of the old coasters based on
life-long experience, and she waxes indignant at the ingratitude
with which Kruboy loyalty is rewarded. "They have devoted
themselves to us English, and they have suffered, laboured,
fought, been massacred and so on with us generation after
generation.... Kruboys are, indeed, the backbone of white
effort in West Africa<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Upper
Guinea Peoples.</div>

<p>But the very worst "sweepings of the Sudanese plateau"
seem to have gathered along the Upper Guinea Coast,
occupied by the already mentioned <i>Tshi</i>, <i>Ewe</i>,
and <i>Yoruba</i> groups<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>. They constitute three
branches of one linguistic, and probably also of
one ethnical family, of which, owing to their historic and
ethnical importance, the reader may be glad to have here
subjoined a somewhat complete tabulated scheme.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ashanti
Folklore.</div>

<p>The <i>Ga</i> of the Volta delta are here bracketed with the
Tshi because A. B. Ellis, our great authority on the Guinea
peoples<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>, considers the two languages to be distantly connected.
He also thinks there is a foundation of fact in the
native traditions, which bring the dominant tribes&mdash;Ashanti,
Fanti, Dahomi, Yoruba, Bini&mdash;from the interior to the coast
districts at no very remote period. Thus it is recorded of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>the Ashanti and Fanti, now hereditary foes, that ages ago
they formed one people who were reduced to the utmost
distress during a long war with some inland power, perhaps
the conquering Muhammadans of the Ghana or Mali empire.
They were saved, however, some by eating of the <i>shan</i>,
others of the <i>fan</i> plant, and of these words,
with the verb <i>di</i>, "to eat," were made the tribal
names <i>Shan-di</i>, <i>Fan-di</i>, now <i>Ashanti</i>, <i>Fanti</i>.
The <i>seppiriba</i> plant, said to have been eaten by the Fanti, is
still called <i>fan</i> when cooked.</p>

<p>Other traditions refer to a time when all were of one
speech, and lived in a far country beyond Salagha, open, flat,
with little bush, and plenty of cattle and sheep, a tolerably
accurate description of the inland Sudanese plateaux. But
then came a red people, said to be the Fulahs, Muhammadans,
who oppressed the blacks and drove them to take refuge in
the forests. Here they thrived and multiplied, and after
many vicissitudes they came down, down, until at last they
reached the coast, with the waves rolling in, the white foam
hissing and frothing on the beach, and thought it was all
boiling water until some one touched it and found it was not
hot, and so to this day they call the sea <i>Eh-huru den o nni<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
shew</i>, "Boiling water not hot," but far inland the sea is still
"Boiling water<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fetishism&mdash;its
true inwardness.</div>

<p>To A. B. Ellis we are indebted especially for the true
explanation of the much used and abused term <i>fetish</i>, as
applied to the native beliefs.  It was of course
already known to be not an African but a Portuguese
word<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>, meaning a charm, amulet, or even
witchcraft. But Ellis shows how it came to be wrongly
applied to all forms of animal and nature worship, and how
the confusion was increased by De Brosses' theory of a
primordial fetishism, and by his statement that it was impossible
to conceive a lower form of religion than fetishism,
which might therefore be assumed to be the beginning of all
religion<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>.</p>

<p>On the contrary it represents rather an advanced stage, as
Ellis discovered after four or five years of careful observation
on the spot. A fetish, he tells us, is something tangible and
inanimate, which is believed to possess power in itself, and is
worshipped for itself alone. Nor can such an object be
picked up anywhere at random, as is commonly asserted, and
he adds that the belief "is arrived at only after considerable
progress has been made in religious ideas, when the older
form of religion becomes secondary and owes its existence to
the confusion of the tangible with the intangible, of the
material with the immaterial; to the belief in the indwelling
god being gradually lost sight of until the power originally
believed to belong to the god, is finally attributed to the
tangible and inanimate object itself."</p>

<p>But now comes a statement that may seem paradoxical to
most students of the evolution of religious ideas. We are
assured that fetishism thus understood is not specially or at
all characteristic of the religion of the Gold Coast natives,
who are in fact "remarkably free from it" and believe in
invisible intangible deities. Some of them may dwell in a
tangible inanimate object, popularly called a "fetish"; but
the idea of the indwelling god is never lost sight of, nor is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the object ever worshipped for its own sake. True fetishism,
the worship of such material objects and images, prevails, on
the contrary, far more "amongst the Negroes of the West
Indies, who have been christianised for more than half-a-century,
than amongst those of West Africa. Hence the
belief in Obeah, still prevalent in the West Indies, which
formerly was a belief in indwelling spirits which inhabited
certain objects, has now become a worship paid to tangible
and inanimate objects, which of themselves are believed to
possess the power to injure. In Europe itself we find
evidence amongst the Roman Catholic populations of the
South, that fetishism is a corruption of a former <i>culte</i>, rather
than a primordial faith. The lower classes there have confused
the intangible with the tangible, and believe that the
images of the saints can both see, hear and feel. Thus we
find the Italian peasants and fishermen beat and ill-treat their
images when their requests have not been complied with....
These appear to be instances of true fetishism<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ancestry
Worship and
the "Customs."</div>

<p>Another phase of religious belief in Upper Guinea is
ancestry worship, which has here been developed to a degree
unknown elsewhere. As the departed have to
be maintained in the same social position beyond
the grave that they enjoyed in this world, they
must be supplied with slaves, wives, and attendants, each
according to his rank. Hence the institution of the so-called
"customs," or anniversary feasts of the dead, accompanied
by the sacrifice of human victims, regulated at first by the
status and afterwards by the whim and caprice of chiefs and
kings. In the capitals of the more powerful states, Ashanti,
Dahomey, Benin, the scenes witnessed at these sanguinary
rites rivalled in horror those held in honour of the Aztec
gods. Details may here be dispensed with on a repulsive
subject, ample accounts of which are accessible from many
sources to the general reader. In any case these atrocities
teach no lesson, except that most religions have waded through
blood to better things, unless arrested in mid-stream by the
intervention of higher powers, as happily in Upper Guinea,
where the human shambles of Kumassi, Abomeh, Benin and
most other places have now been swept away.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">The Benin
Bronzes.</div>

<p>On the capture of Benin by the English in 1897 a rare
and unexpected prize fell into the hands of ethnologists.
Here was found a large assortment of carved
ivories, woodwork, and especially a series of
about 300 bronze and brass plates or panels
with figures of natives and Europeans, armed and in armour,
in full relief, all cast by the <i>cire perdue</i> process<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>, some barbaric,
others, and especially a head in the round of a young
negress, showing high artistic skill. Many of these remarkable
objects are in the British Museum, where they have been
studied by C. H. Read and O. M. Dalton<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>, who are evidently
right in assigning the better class to the sixteenth century,
and to the aid, if not the hand, of some Portuguese artificers
in the service of the King of Benin. They add that "casting
of an inferior kind continues down to the present time," and it
may here be mentioned that armour has long been and is still
worn by the cavalry, and even their horses, in the Muhammadan
states of Central Sudan. "The chiefs (<i>Kashell&aacute;wa</i>)
who serve as officers under the Sultan [of Bornu] and act as
his bodyguard wear jackets of chain armour and cuirasses of
coats of mail<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>." It is clear that metal casting in a large way
has long been practised by the semi-civilised peoples of Sudan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mossi.</div>

<p>Within the great bend of the Niger the veil, first slightly
raised by Barth in the middle of the nineteenth century,
has now been drawn aside by L. G. Binger,
F. D. Lugard and later explorers. Here the
<i>Mossi</i>, <i>Borgu</i> and others have hitherto more or less successfully
resisted the Moslem advance, and are consequently for
the most part little removed from the savage state. Even
the "Faithful" wear the cloak of Isl&aacute;m somewhat loosely,
and the level of their culture may be judged from the case of
the Im&aacute;m of Diulasu, who pestered Binger for nostrums
and charms against ailments, war, and misfortunes. What he
wanted chiefly to know was the names of Abraham's two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
wives. "Tell me these," he would say, "and my fortune is
made, for I dreamt it the other night; you must tell me;
I really must have those names or I'm lost<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>."</p>

<p>In some districts the ethnical confusion is considerable,
and when Binger arrived at the Court of the Mossi King,
Baikary, he was addressed successively in Mossi, Hausa,
Songhai, and Fulah, until at last it was discovered that
Mandingan was the only native language he understood.
Waghadugu, capital of the chief Mossi state, comprises
several distinct quarters occupied respectively by Mandingans,
Marengas (Songhai), Zang-wer'os (Hausas), Chilmigos
(Fulahs), Mussulman and heathen Mossis, the whole population
scarcely exceeding 5000. However, perfect harmony prevails,
the Mossi themselves being extremely tolerant despite the
long religious wars they have had to wage against the fanatical
Fulahs and other Muhammadan aggressors<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">African
Agnostics.</div>

<p>Religious indifference is indeed a marked characteristic of
this people, and the case is mentioned of a nominal Mussulman
prince who could even read and write, and
say his prayers, but whose two sons "knew
nothing at all," or, as we should say, were
"Agnostics." One of them, however, it is fair to add, is
claimed by both sides, the Moslems asserting that he says
his prayers in secret, the heathens that he drinks <i>dolo</i> (palm-wine),
which of course no true believer is supposed ever to do.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Central Sudanese.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">General
Ethnical and
Social
Relations.</div>

<p>In Central Sudan, that is, the region stretching from the
Niger to Wadai, a tolerably clean sweep has been made of
the aborigines, except along the southern fringe
and in parts of the Chad basin. For many
centuries Isl&aacute;m has here been firmly established,
and in Negroland Isl&aacute;m is synonymous with a
greater or less degree of miscegenation. The native tribes
who resisted the fiery Arab or Tuareg or Tibu proselytisers
were for the most part either extirpated, or else driven to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
southern uplands about the Congo-Chad water-parting. All
who accepted the Koran became merged with the conquerors
in a common negroid population, which supplied the new
material for the development of large social communities and
powerful political states.</p>

<p>Under these conditions the old tribal organisations were
in great measure dissolved, and throughout its historic period
of about a millennium Central Sudan is found mainly occupied
by peoples gathered together in a small number of political
systems, each with its own language and special institutions,
but all alike accepting Isl&aacute;m as the State religion. Such are
or were the Songhai empire, the Hausa States, and the
kingdoms of Bornu with Kanem and Baghirmi, and these
jointly cover the whole of Central Sudan as above defined.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Songhai

<p><i>Songhais</i><a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>. How completely the tribe<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> has merged in the
people<a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> may be inferred from the mere statement that,
although no longer an independent nation<a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>, the
negroid Songhais form a single ethnical group
of about two million souls, all of one speech
and one religion, and all distinguished by somewhat uniform
physical and mental characters. This territory lies mainly
about the borderlands between Sudan and the Sahara, stretching
from Timbuktu east to the Asben oasis and along both
banks of the Niger from Lake Debo round to the Sokoto
confluence, and also at some points reaching as far as the
Hombori hills within the great bend of the Niger.</p>

<p>Here they are found in the closest connection with the
Ireghenaten ("mixed") Tuaregs, and elsewhere with other
Tuaregs, and with Arabs, Fulahs or Hausas<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>, so that exclusively
Songhai communities are now somewhat rare. But
the bulk of the race is still concentrated in Gurma and in the
district between Gobo and Timbuktu, the two chief cities of
the old Songhai empire.</p>

<p>They are a distinctly negroid people, presenting various
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>shades of intermixture with the surrounding Hamites and
Semites, but generally of a very deep brown or
blackish colour, with somewhat regular features
and that peculiar long, black, and ringletty hair,
which is so characteristic of Negro and Caucasic blends, as
seen amongst the Trarsas and Braknas of the Senegal, the
Bejas, Danakils, and many Abyssinians of the region between
the Nile and the Red Sea. Barth, to whom we still owe the
best account of this historical people, describes them as of a
dull, morose temperament, the most unfriendly and churlish
of all the peoples visited by him in Negroland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Egyptian
Theories.</div>

<p>This writer's suggestion that they may have formerly had
relations with the Egyptians<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> has been revived in an exaggerated
form by M. F&eacute;lix Dubois, whose views
have received currency in England through
uncritical notices of his <i>Timbouctou la Myst&eacute;rieuse</i>
(Paris, 1897).  But there is no "mystery" in the
matter. The Songhai are a Sudanese people,
whose exodus from Egypt is a myth, and whose
Kissur language, as it is called, has not the
remotest connection with any form of speech known to have
been at any time current in the Nile Valley<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>. Nor has it any
evident affinities with any group of African tongues.  H. H.
Johnston regards the Songhai as the result of the mixing of
"the Libyan section of the Hamitic peoples, reinforced by
Berbers (Iberians) from Spain," with the pre-existing Fulah
type and the Negroids; as also from the far earlier intercourse
between the Fulah and the Negro<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Songhai
Records.</div>

<p>The Songhai empire, like that of the rival Mandingans,
claims a respectable antiquity, its reputed founder Za-el-Yemeni
having flourished about 680 <small>A.D.</small> Za
Kasi, fifteenth in succession from the founder,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
was the first Muhammadan ruler (1009); but about 1326
the country was reduced by the Mandingans, and remained
throughout the fourteenth and a great part of the fifteenth
century virtually subject to the Mali empire, although
Ali Killun, founder of the new Sonni dynasty, had acquired
a measure of independence about 1335-6. But the political
supremacy of the Songhai people dates only from about 1464,
when Sonni Ali, sixteenth of the Sonni dynasty, known in
history as "the great tyrant and famous miscreant," threw off
the Mandingan yoke, "and changed the whole face of this
part of Africa by prostrating the kingdom of Melle<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>." Under
his successor, Muhammad Askia<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>, "perhaps the greatest
sovereign that ever ruled over Negroland<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>," the Songhai
Empire acquired its greatest expansion, extending from the
heart of Hausaland to the Atlantic seaboard, and from the
Mossi country to the Tuat oasis, south of Morocco. Although
unfavourably spoken of by Leo Africanus, Askia is described
by Ahmed B&aacute;b&aacute; as governing the subject peoples "with
justice and equity, causing well-being and comfort to spring
up everywhere within the borders of his extensive dominions,
and introducing such of the institutions of Muhammadan
civilisation as he considered might be useful to his subjects<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>."</p>

<p>Askia also made the Mecca pilgrimage with a great show
of splendour. But after his reign (1492-1529) the Songhai
power gradually declined, and was at last overthrown by
Mulay Hamed, Emperor of Morocco, in 1591-2. Ahmed
B&aacute;b&aacute;, the native chronicler, was involved in the ruin of his
people<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>, and since then the Songhai nation has been broken
into fragments, subject here to Hausas, there to Fulahs, elsewhere
to Tuaregs, and, since the French occupation of
Timbuktu (1894), to the hated Giaur.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hausas&mdash;their
dominant
Social Position.</div>

<p><i>Hausas.</i> In everything that constitutes the real greatness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>of a nation, the Hausas may rightly claim preeminence
amongst all the peoples of Negroland. No
doubt early in the nineteenth century the historical
Hausa States, occupying the whole region
between the Niger and Bornu, were overrun and reduced by
the fanatical Fulah bands under Othm&aacute;n Dan Fodye. But
the Hausas, in a truer sense than the Greeks, "have captured
their rude conquerors<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>," for they have even largely assimilated
them physically to their own type, and the Hausa nationality
is under British auspices asserting its natural social, industrial
and commercial predominance throughout Central and even
parts of Western Sudan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hausa Speech
and Mental
Qualities.</div>

<p>It could not well be otherwise, seeing that the Hausas
form a compact body of some five million peaceful and industrious
Sudanese, living partly in numerous farmsteads amid
their well-tilled cotton, indigo, pulse, and corn fields, partly
in large walled cities and great trading centres such as Kano<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>,
Katsena, Yacoba, whose intelligent and law-abiding inhabitants
are reckoned by many tens of thousands. Their
melodious tongue, with a vocabulary containing
perhaps 10,000 words<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>, has long been the great
medium of intercourse throughout Sudan from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Lake Chad to and beyond the Niger, and is daily acquiring
even greater preponderance amongst all the settled and trading
populations of these regions.</p>

<p>But though showing a marked preference for peaceful
pursuits, the Hausas are by no means an effeminate people.
Largely enlisted in the British service, they have at all times
shown fighting qualities of a high order under their English
officers, and a well-earned tribute has been paid to their
military prowess amongst others by Sir George Goldie and
Lieut. Vandeleur<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>. With the Hausas on her side England
need assuredly fear no rivals to her beneficent sway over the
teeming populations of the fertile plains and plateaux of
Central Sudan, which is on the whole perhaps the most
favoured land in Africa north of the equator.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hausa Origins.</div>

<p>According to the national traditions, which go back to no
very remote period<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>, the seven historical Hausa States known
as the "Hausa bokoy" ("the seven Hausas")
take their name from the eponymous heroes
<i>Biram</i>, <i>Daura</i>, <i>Gober</i>, <i>Kano</i>, <i>Rano</i>, <i>Katsena</i> and <i>Zegzeg</i>, all
said to be sprung from the Deggaras, a Berber tribe settled
to the north of Munyo. From Biram, the original seat, the
race and its language spread to seven other provinces&mdash;<i>Zanfara</i>,
<i>Kebbi</i>, <i>Nupe</i> (<i>Nyffi</i>), <i>Gwari</i>, <i>Yauri</i>, <i>Yariba</i> and
<i>Kororofa</i>, which in contempt are called the "Banza bokoy"
("the seven Upstarts"). All form collectively the Hausa
domain in the widest sense.</p>

<p>Authentic history is quite recent, and even Komayo,
reputed founder of Katsena, dates only from about the
fourteenth century. Ibrahim Maji, who was the first Moslem
ruler, is assigned to the latter part of the fifteenth century,
and since then the chief events have been associated with the
Fulah wars, ending in the absorption of all the Hausa States
in the unstable Fulah empire of Sokoto at the beginning of
the nineteenth century. With the fall of Kano and Sokoto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
in 1903 British supremacy was finally established throughout
the Hausa States, now termed Northern Nigeria<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethnical and
Political Relations
in the
Chad Basin.</div>

<p><i>Kanembu</i>; <i>Kanuri</i><a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>; <i>Baghirmi</i>, <i>Mosgu</i>. Round about
the shores of Lake Chad are grouped three other historical
Muhammadan nations, the Kanembu ("People
of Kanem") on the north, the Kanuri of Bornu
on the west, and the Baghirmi on the south
side. The last named was conquered by the
Sultan of Wadai in 1871, and overrun by Rabah Zobeir,
half Arab, half Negro adventurer, in 1890.  But in 1897
Emile Gentil<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>, French commissioner for the district, placed
the country under French protection, although French authority
was not firmly established until the death of Rabah
and the rout of his sons in 1901. At the same time Kanem
was brought under French control, and shortly afterwards
Bornu was divided between Great Britain, France and
Germany.</p>

<p>In this region the ethnical relations are considerably more
complex than in the Hausa States. Here Isl&aacute;m has had
greater obstacles to contend with than on the more open
western plateaux, and many of the pagan aborigines have
been able to hold their ground either in the archipelagos of
Lake Chad (<i>Yedinas, Kuri, Buduma</i><a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>), or in the swampy
tracts and uplands of the Logon-Shari basin (<i>Mosgu</i>, <i>Mandara</i>,
<i>Makari</i>, etc.).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Aborigines.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Isl&aacute;m and
Heathendom.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Slave-Hunting.</div>

<p>It was also the policy of the Muhammadans, whose system
is based on slavery, not to push their religious zeal too far,
for, if all the natives were converted, where
could they procure a constant supply of slaves,
those who accept the teachings of the Prophet being <i>ipso
facto</i> entitled to their freedom? Hence the pagan districts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>were, and still are, regarded as convenient preserves, happy
hunting-grounds to be raided from time to time, but not
utterly wasted; to be visited by organised razzias just often
enough to keep up the supply in the home and foreign
markets. This system, controlled by the local governments
themselves, has long prevailed about the borderlands
between Isl&aacute;m and heathendom, as we
know from Barth, Nachtigal, and one or two
other travellers, who have had reluctantly to accompany the
periodical slave-hunting expeditions from Bornu and Baghirmi
to the territories of the pagan Mosgu people with their
numerous branches (<i>Margi, Mandara, Makari, Logon,
Gamergu, Keribina</i>) and the other aborigines (<i>Bede, Ngisem,
So, Kerrikerri, Babir</i>) on the northern slopes of the Congo-Chad
water-parting. As usual on such occasions, there is a
great waste of life, many perishing in defence
of their homes or even through sheer wantonness,
besides those carried away captives. "A large number
of slaves had been caught this day," writes Barth, "and in
the evening a great many more were brought in; altogether
they were said to have taken one thousand, and there were
certainly not less than five hundred. To our utmost horror,
not less than 170 full-grown men were mercilessly slaughtered
in cold blood, the greater part of them being allowed to bleed
to death, a leg having been severed from the body<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>." There
was probably just then a glut in the market.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arboreal
Strongholds.</div>

<p>A curious result of these relations is that in the wooded
districts some of the natives have reverted to arboreal habits,
taking refuge during the raids in the branches
of huge bombax-trees converted into temporary
strongholds. Round the vertical stem of these
forest giants is erected a breast-high look-out, while the
higher horizontal branches, less exposed to the fire of the
enemy, support strongly-built huts and store-houses, where
the families of the fugitives take refuge with their effects,
including, as Nachtigal assures us<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>, their domestic animals,
such as goats, dogs, and poultry. During the siege of the
a&euml;rial fortress, which is often successfully defended, long
light ladders of withies are let down at night, when no attack
need be feared, and the supply of water and provisions is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
thus renewed from <i>caches</i> or hiding-places round about. In
1872 Nachtigal accompanied a predatory excursion to the
pagan districts south of Baghirmi, when an attack was made
on one of these tree-fortresses. Such citadels can be stormed
only at a heavy loss, and as the Gaberi (Baghirmi) warriors
had no tools capable of felling the great bombax-tree, they
were fain to rest satisfied with picking off a poor wretch now
and then, and barbarously mutilating the bodies as they fell
from the overhanging branches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mosgu Types
and Contrasts.</div>

<p>Some of these aborigines disfigure their faces by the disk-like
lip-ornament, which is also fashionable in Nyassaland,
and even amongst the South American Botocudos.
The type often differs greatly, and while
some of the widespread Mosgu tribes are of a
dirty black hue, with disagreeable expression, wide open
nostrils, thick lips, high cheek-bones, coarse bushy hair, and
disproportionate knock-kneed legs, other members of the
same family astonished Barth "by the beauty and symmetry
of their forms, and by the regularity of their features, which
in some had nothing of what is called the Negro type. But
I was still more astonished at their complexion, which was
very different in different individuals, being in some of a
glossy black, and in others of a light copper, or rather rhubarb
colour, the intermediate shades being almost entirely wanting.
I observed in one house a really beautiful female who, with
her son, about eight or nine years of age, formed a most
charming group, well worthy of the hand of an accomplished
artist. The boy's form did not yield in any respect to the
beautiful symmetry of the most celebrated Grecian statues.
His hair, indeed, was very short and curled, but not woolly.
He, as well as his mother and the whole family, were of a
pale or yellowish-red complexion, like rhubarb<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>."</p>

<p>There is no suggestion of albinism, and the explanation
of such strange contrasts must await further exploration in
the whole of this borderland of Negroes and Bantus about
the divide between the Chad and the Congo basins. The
country has until lately been traversed only at rare intervals
by pioneers, interested more in political than in anthropological
matters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kanem-Bornu

<p>Of the settled and more or less cultured peoples in the

introduce a fresh element of confusion in this
region, being more allied in type and speech
to the Hamitic Tibus than to the Negro stock,
or at least taking a transitional position between the two; the
<i>Kanuri</i>, the ruling people in Bornu, of somewhat coarse
Negroid appearance<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>; and the southern <i>Baghirmi</i>, also
decidedly Negroid, originally supposed to have come from
the Upper Shari and White Nile districts<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>. Their civilisation,
such as it is, has been developed exclusively under Moslem
influences, but it has never penetrated much below the
surface. The people are everywhere extremely rude, and for
the most part unlettered, although the meagre and not altogether
trustworthy Kanem-Bornu records date from the time
of Sef, reputed founder of the monarchy about 800 <small>A.D.</small>
Duku, second in descent from Sef, is doubtfully
referred to about 850 <small>A.D.</small> Ham&eacute;, founder of a
new dynasty, flourished towards the end of the
eleventh century (1086-97), and Dunama, one of his successors,
is said to have extended his sway over a great part
of the Sahara, including the whole of Fezzan (1221-59).
Under Omar (1394-98) a divorce took place between Kanem
and Bornu, and henceforth the latter country has remained
the chief centre of political power in the Chad basin.</p>

<p>A long series of civil wars was closed by Ali (1472-1504),
who founded the present capital, Birni, and whose grandson,
Muhammad, brought the empire of Bornu to the highest

began the wars with the Fulahs, who, after bringing the
empire to the verge of ruin, were at last overthrown by the
aid of the Kanem people, and since 1819 Bornu has been
ruled by the present Kanem&iacute;y&iacute;n dynasty, which though temporarily

<h3><span class="smcap">Eastern Sudanese.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Range of the
Negro in Eastern
Sudan.</div>

<p>As some confusion prevails regarding the expression
"Eastern Sudan," I may here explain that it bears a very
different meaning, according as it is used in a
political or an ethnical sense. Politically it is
practically synonymous with Egyptian Sudan,
that is the whole region from Darfur to the Red Sea which
was ruled or misruled by the Khedivial Government before
the revolt of the Mahdi (1883-4), and was restored to Egypt
by the British occupation of Khartum in 1898. Ethnically
Eastern Sudan comprises all the lands east of the Chad
basin, where the Negro or Negroid populations are predominant,
that is to say, Wadai, Darfur, and Kordofan in the
West, the Nile Valley from the frontier of Egypt proper
south to Albert Nyanza, both slopes of the Nile-Congo
divide (the western tributaries of the White Nile and the
Welle-Makua affluent of the Congo), lastly the Sobat Valley
with some Negro enclaves east of the White Nile, and even
south of the equator (Kavirondo, Semliki Valley).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mabas.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Ethnical
Relations in
Wadai.</div>

<p>Throughout this region the fusion of the aborigines with
Hamites and Arabs, Tuareg, or Tibu Moslem intruders,
wherever they have penetrated, has been far
less complete than in Central and Western
Sudan. Thus in Wadai the dominant Maba people, whence
the country is often called Dar-Maba ("Mabaland"), are
rather Negro than Negroid, with but a slight
strain of foreign blood.  In the northern districts
the <i>Zogh&aacute;wa</i>, <i>Gura'an</i>, <i>Baele</i> and <i>Bulala</i>
Tibus keep quite aloof from the blacks, as do elsewhere; the
<i>Aramkas</i>, as the Arabs are collectively called in Wadai. Yet
the <i>Maham&iacute;d</i> and some other Bedouin tribes have here been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
settled for over 500 years, and it was through their assistance
that the Mabas acquired the political supremacy they have
enjoyed since the seventeenth century, when they reduced or
expelled the <i>Tynjurs</i><a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>, the former ruling race, said to be
Nubians originally from Dongola. It was Abd-el-Kerim,
founder of the new Moslem Maba state, who gave the country
its present name in honour of his grandfather, <i>Wadai</i>. His
successor Khar&uacute;b I removed the seat of government to
Wara, where Vogel was murdered in 1856. Abeshr, the
present capital, dates only from the year 1850. Except for
Nachtigal, who crossed the frontier in 1873, nothing was
known of the land or its people until the French occupation
at the end of the last century (1899). Since that date it has
been prominent as the scene of the attack on a French
column and the death of its leader, Colonel Moll, in 1910,
and the tragic murder of Lieutenant Boyd Alexander earlier
in the same year<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Nubian
Problem.</div>

<p><i>Nubas.</i> As in Wadai, the intruding and native populations
have been either imperfectly or not at all assimilated in
Darfur and Kordofan, where the Muhammadan
Semites still boast of their pure Arab descent<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>,
and form powerful confederacies. Chief among
these are the <i>Baggara</i> (Baqqara, "cow-herds"), cattle-keepers
and agriculturalists, of whom some are as dark as the blackest
negroes, though many are fine-looking, with regular, well-shaped
features. Their form of Arabic is notoriously corrupt.
Their rivals, the <i>Jaalan</i> (Jalin, Jahalin), are mostly riverain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
"Arabs," a learned tribe, containing many scribes, and their
language is said to be closer to classical Arabic than the form
current in Egypt. These are the principal slave-hunters of
the Sudan, and the famous Zobeir belonged to their tribe.
The <i>Yemanieh</i> are largely traders, and trace their origin
from South Arabia. The <i>Kababish</i> are the wealthiest camel-owning
tribe, perhaps less contaminated by negro blood than
any other Arab tribe in the Sudan<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>. The <i>Nuba</i> and the
<i>Nubians</i> have been a source of much confusion, but recent
investigations in the field such as those of C. G. Seligman<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
and H. A. MacMichael<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>, and the publications of the Archaeological
Survey of Nubia conducted by G. A. Reisner, help to
elucidate the problem. We have first of all to get rid of the
"Nuba-Fulah" family, which was introduced by Fr. M&uuml;ller
and accepted by some English writers, but has absolutely
no existence. The two languages, although both of the
agglutinative Sudanese type, are radically distinct in all their
structural, lexical, and phonetic elements, and the two peoples
are equally distinct. The Fulahs are of North African origin,
although many have in recent times been largely assimilated
to their black Sudanese subjects. The Nuba on the contrary
belong originally to the Negro stock, with hair of the common
negro type, and are among the darkest skinned tribes in the
Sudan, their colour varying from a dark chocolate brown to
the darkest shade of brown black.</p>

<p>But rightly to understand the question we have carefully
to avoid confusion between the Nubians of the Nile Valley
and the Negro <i>Nubas</i>, who gave their name to the Nuba
Mountains, Kordofan, where most of the aborigines (<i>Kargo,
Kulfan, Kolaji, Tumali, Lafofa, Eliri, Talodi</i>) still belong
to this connection<a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>. Kordofan is probably itself a Nuba
word meaning "Land of the Kordo" (<i>f&aacute;n</i> = Arab, <i>d&aacute;r</i>, land,
country). There is a certain amount of anthropological
evidence to connect the Nuba with the <i>Fur</i> and the <i>Kara</i> of
Darfur to the west<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>. But it is a different anthropological
type that is represented in the three groups of <i>Matokki</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
(<i>Kenus</i>) between the First Cataract and Wadi-el-Arab, the
<i>Mahai</i> (<i>Marisi</i>) between Korosko and Wadi-Halfa, at the
Second Cataract, and the <i>Dongolawi</i>, of the province of
Dongola between Wadi-Halfa and Jebel Deja near Meroe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nubian Origins
and Affinities.</div>

<p>These three groups, all now Muhammadans, but formerly
Christians, constitute collectively the so-called "Nubians" of
European writers, but call themselves <i>Barabra</i>,
Plural of <i>Berberi</i>, <i>i.e.</i> people of Berber, although
they do not at present extend so far up the
Nile as that town<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>. Possibly these are Strabo's "Noubai,
who dwell on the left bank of the Nile in Libya [Africa], a
great nation etc.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>"; and are also to be identified with the
<i>Nobatae</i>, who in Diocletian's time were settled, some in the
Kharga oasis, others in the Nile Valley about Meroe, to
guard the frontiers of the empire against the incursions of
the restless Blemmues. But after some time they appear to
have entered into peaceful relations with these Hamites, the
present Bejas, even making common cause with them against
the Romans; but the confederacy was crushed by Maximinus
in 451, though perhaps not before crossings had taken place
between the Nobatae and the Caucasic Bejas. Then these
Bejas withdrew to their old homes, which they still occupy,
between the Nile and the Red Sea above Egypt, while
the Nobatae, embracing Christianity, as is said, in 545,
established the powerful kingdom of Dongola which lasted
over 800 years, and was finally overthrown by the Arabs in
the fourteenth century, since which time the Nile Nubians
have been Muhammadans.</p>

<p>There still remains the problem of language which, as
shown by Lepsius<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>, differs but slightly from that now current
amongst the Kordofan Nubas. But this similarity only
holds in the north, and is now shown to be due to Berberine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
immigration into Kordofan<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>. Recent investigations show
that the Nuba and the Barabra, in spite of this linguistic
similarity which has misled certain authors<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>, are not to be
regarded as belonging to the same race<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>. "The Nuba are a
tall, stoutly built muscular people, with a dark, almost black
skin. They are predominantly mesaticephalic, for although
cephalic indices under 70 and over 80 both occur, nearly
60 per cent. of the individuals measured are mesaticephals,
the remaining being dolichocephalic and brachycephalic in
about equal proportions." The hair is invariably woolly.
The Barabra, on the contrary, is of slight, or more commonly
medium build, not particularly muscular and in skin colour
varies from a yellowish to a chocolate brown. The hair is
commonly curly or wavy and may be almost straight, while
the features are not uncommonly absolutely non-Negroid.
"Thus there can be no doubt that the two peoples are
essentially different in physical characters and the same holds
good on the cultural side" (p. 611). Barabra were identified
by Lepsius with the Wawat, a people frequently mentioned
in Egyptian records, and recent excavations by the members
of the Archaeological Survey of Nubia show a close connection
with the predynastic Egyptians, a connection supported
also on physical grounds. It seems strange, therefore, to
meet with repeated reference on Egyptian monuments to
Negroes in Nubia when, as proved by excavations, the inhabitants
were by no means Negroes or even frankly Negroid.
Seligman's solution of the difficulty is as follows (p. 619).
It seems that only one explanation is tenable, namely that for
a period subsequent to the Middle Kingdom the country in
the neighbourhood of the Second Cataract became essentially
a Negro country and may have remained in this condition
for some little time. Then a movement in the opposite
direction set in; the Negroes, diminished by war, were in
part driven back by the great conquerors of the New Empire;
those that were left mixed with the Egyptian garrisons and
traders and once more a hybrid race arose which, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
preserved the language of its Negro ancestors. Although
Seligman regards the conclusion that this race gave rise
directly to the present-day inhabitants of Nubia as "premature,"
and suggests further mixture with the Beja of
the eastern deserts, Elliot Smith recognises the essential
similarity between the homogeneous blend of Egyptian
and Negro traits which characterise the Middle Nubian
people (contemporary with the Middle Empire, XII-XVII
dynasties), a type which "seems to have remained dominant
in Nubia ever since then, for the span of almost 4000
years<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Negro
Peoples of the
Nile-Congo
Watersheds.</div>

<p>Before the incursions of the Nubian-Arab traders and
raiders, who began to form settlements (<i>zeribas</i>, fenced stations)
in the Upper Nile regions above Khartum
about the middle of the nineteenth century,
most of the Nile-Congo divide (White Nile
tributaries and Welle-Makua basin) belonged in
the strictest sense to the Negro domain. Sudanese tribes,
and even great nations reckoned by millions, had been for
ages in almost undisturbed possession, not only of the main
stream from the equatorial lakes to and beyond the Sobat
junction, but also of the Sobat Valley itself, and of the
numerous south-western head-waters of the White Nile converging
about Lake No above the Sobat junction. Nearly
all the Nile peoples&mdash;the <i>Shilluks</i> and <i>Dinkas</i> about the
Sobat confluence, the <i>Bari</i> and <i>Nuers</i> of the Bahr-el-Jebel,
the <i>Bongos</i> (<i>Dors</i>), <i>Rols</i>, <i>Golos</i>, <i>Mittus</i>, <i>Madis</i>, <i>Makarakas</i>,
<i>Abakas</i>, <i>Mundus</i>, and many others about the western affluents,
as well as the <i>Funj</i> of Senaar&mdash;had been brought under the
Khedivial rule before the revolt of the Mahdi.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Political
Relations.</div>

<p>The same fate had already overtaken or was threatening
the formerly powerful <i>Mombuttu</i> (<i>Mangbattu</i>) and <i>Zandeh</i><a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
nations of the Welle lands, as well as the <i>Krej</i> and others
about the low watersheds of the Nile-Congo and Chad basins.
Since then the Welle groups have been subjected to the
jurisdiction of the Congo Free State, while the
political destinies of the Nilotic tribes must
henceforth be controlled by the British masters
of the Nile lands from the Great Lakes to the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Although grouped as Negroes proper, very few of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Nilotic peoples present the almost ideal type of the blacks,
such as those of Upper Guinea and the Atlantic coast of
West Sudan. The complexion is in general less black, the
nose less broad at the base, the lips less everted (Shilluks
and one or two others excepted), the hair rather less frizzly,
the dolichocephaly and prognathism less marked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two Physical
Types.</div>

<p>Apart from the more delicate shades of transition, due to
diverse interminglings with Hamites and Semites, two distinct
types may be plainly distinguished&mdash;one
black, often very tall, with long thin legs, and
long-headed (<i>Shilluks, Dinkas, Bari, Nuers,
Alur</i>), the other reddish or ruddy brown, more thick-set,
and short-headed (<i>Bongos</i>, <i>Golos</i>, <i>Makarakas</i>, with the
kindred <i>Zandehs</i> of the Welle region). No explanation has
been offered of their brachycephaly, which is all the more
difficult to account for, inasmuch as it is characteristic neither
of the aboriginal Negro nor of the intruding Hamitic and
Semitic elements. Have we here an indication of the transition
suspected by many between the true long-headed Negro
and the round-headed Negrillo, who is also brownish, and
formerly ranged as far north as the Nile head-streams, as
would appear from the early Egyptian records (Chap. IV.)?
Schweinfurth found that the Bongos were "hardly removed
from the lowest grade of brachycephaly<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>," and the same is
largely true of the Zandehs and their Makaraka cousins, as
noticed by Junker: "The skull also in many of these peoples
approaches the round form, whereas the typical Negro is
assumed to be long-headed<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>." But so great is the diversity
of appearance throughout the whole of this region, including
even "a striking Semitic type," that this observer was driven
to the conclusion that "woolly hair, common to all, forms in
fact the only sure characteristic of the Negro<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Dinka.</div>

<p>Dinka is the name given to a congeries of independent
tribes spread over a vast area, stretching from 300 miles
south of Khartum to within 100 miles of Gondokoro,
and reaching many miles to the west in
the Bahr-el-Ghazal Province. All these tribes according to
C. G. Seligman<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> call themselves <i>Jieng</i> or <i>Jenge</i>, corrupted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
by the Arabs into Dinka; but no Dinka nation has arisen,
for the tribes have never recognised a supreme chief, as do
their neighbours, the Shilluk, nor have they even been united
under a military despot, as the Zulu were united under
Chaka. They differ in manners and customs and even in
physique and are often at war with one another. One of the
most obvious distinctions in habits is between the relatively
powerful cattle-owning Dinka and the small and comparatively
poor tribes who have no cattle and scarcely cultivate the
ground, but live in the marshes in the neighbourhood of the
Sudd, and depend largely for their sustenance on fishing and
hippopotamus-hunting. Their villages, which are generally
dirty and evil-smelling, are built on ground which rises but
little above the reed-covered surface of the country. The
Dinka community is largely autonomous under leadership of
a chief or headman (<i>bain</i>) who is sometimes merely the local
magician, but in one community in each tribe he is the
hereditary rain-maker whose wish is law. "Cattle form the
economic basis of Dinka society; ... they are the currency in
which bride-price and blood-fines are paid; and the desire
to acquire a neighbour's herds is the common cause of those
inter-tribal raids which constitute Dinka warfare."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Linguistic
Groups.</div>

<p>Some uniformity appears to prevail amongst the languages
of the Nile-Welle lands, and from the rather scanty materials
collected by Junker, Fr. M&uuml;ller was able to
construct an "Equatorial Linguistic Family,"
including the Mangbattu, Zandeh, Barmbo,
Madi, Bangba, Krej, Golo and others, on both sides of the
water-parting. Leo Reinisch, however, was not convinced,
and in a letter addressed to the author declared that "in the
absence of sentences it is impossible to determine the grammatical
structure of Mangbattu and the other languages. At
the same time we may detect certain relations, not to the
Nilotic, but the Bantu tongues. It may therefore be inferred
that Mangbattu and the others have a tolerably close relationship
to the Bantu, and may even be remotely akin to it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
judging from their tendency to prefix formations<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>."  Future
research will show how far this conjecture is justified.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mental
Qualities.</div>

<p>Although Isl&aacute;m has made considerable progress, throughout
the greater part of the Sudanese region, though not
among the Nilotic tribes, the bulk of the people
are still practically pagan. Witchcraft continues
to flourish amongst the equatorial peoples,
and important events are almost everywhere attended by
sanguinary rites. These are absent among the true Nilotics.
The Dinka are totemic, with ancestor-worship. The Shilluk
have a cult of divine kings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cannibalism.</div>

<p>Cannibalism however, in some of its most repulsive forms,
prevails amongst the Zandehs, who barter in human fat as
a universal staple of trade, and amongst the
Mangbattu, who cure for future use the bodies
of the slain in battle and "drive their prisoners before them,
as butchers drive sheep to the shambles, and these are only
reserved to fall victims on a later day to their horrible and
sickly greediness<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Cannibal
Zone.</div>

<p>In fact here we enter the true "cannibal zone," which, as
I have elsewhere shown, was in former ages diffused all over
Central and South Africa, or, it would be more
correct to say, over the whole continent<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>, but
has in recent times been mainly confined to "the
region stretching west and east from the Gulf of Guinea to
the western head-streams of the White Nile, and from below
the equator northwards in the direction of Adam&aacute;wa, Dar-Banda
and Dar-Fertit. Wherever explorers have penetrated
into this least-known region of the continent they have found
the practice fully established, not merely as a religious rite or
a privilege reserved for priests, but as a recognised social
institution<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Arts and
Industries.</div>

<p>Yet many of these cannibal peoples, especially the Mangbattus
and Zandehs, are skilled agriculturists, and cultivate
some of the useful industries, such as iron and
copper smelting and casting, weaving, pottery
and wood-carving, with great success. The
form and ornamental designs of their utensils display real
artistic taste, while the temper of their iron implements is
often superior to that of the imported European hardware.
Here again the observation has been made that the tribes
most addicted to cannibalism also excel in mental qualities
and physical energy. Nor are they strangers to the finer
feelings of human nature, and above all the surrounding
peoples the Zandeh anthropophagists are distinguished by
their regard and devotion for their women and children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">High
Appreciation of
Pictorial Art.</div>

<p>In one respect all these peoples show a higher degree of
intelligence even than the Arabs and Hamites. "My later
experiences," writes Junker, "revealed the remarkable
fact that certain negro peoples, such
as the Niam-Niams, the Mangbattus and the
Bantus of Uganda and Unyoro, display quite a surprising
understanding of figured illustrations or pictures of plastic
objects, which is not as a rule exhibited by the Arabs and
Arabised Hamites of North-east Africa. Thus the Unyoro
chief, Riongo, placed photographs in their proper position,
and was able to identify the negro portraits as belonging to
the Shuli, Lango, or other tribes, of which he had a personal
knowledge. This I have called a remarkable fact, because
it bespoke in the lower races a natural faculty for observation,
a power to recognise what for many Arabs or Egyptians of
high rank was a hopeless puzzle. An Egyptian pasha in
Khartum could never make out how a human face in profile
showed only one eye and one ear, and he took the portrait of
a fashionable Parisian lady in extremely low dress for that of the
bearded sun-burnt American naval officer who had shown him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the photograph<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>." From this one is almost tempted to infer
that, amongst Moslem peoples, all sense of plastic, figurative,
or pictorial art has been deadened by the Koranic precept
forbidding the representation of the human form in any way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sense of
Humour.</div>

<p>The Welle peoples show themselves true Negroes in the
possession of another and more precious quality, the sense of
humour, although this is probably a quality
which comes late in the life of a race. Anyhow
it is a distinct Negro characteristic, which
Junker was able to turn to good account during the building
of his famous <i>Lacrima</i> station in Ndoruma's country. "In
all this I could again notice how like children the Negroes
are in many respects. Once at work they seemed animated
by a sort of childlike sense of honour. They delighted in
praise, though even a frown or a word of reproach could also
excite their hilarity. Thus a loud burst of laughter would,
for instance, follow the contrast between a piece of good and
bad workmanship. Like children, they would point the
finger of scorn at each other<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>."</p>

<p>One morning Ndoruma, hearing that they had again
struck work, had the great war-drum beaten, whereupon they
rushed to arms and mustered in great force from all quarters.
But on finding that there was no enemy to march against,
and that they had only been summoned to resume operations
at the station, they enjoyed the joke hugely, and after a
general explosion of laughter at the way they had been taken
in, laid aside their weapons and returned cheerfully to work.
Some English overseers have already discovered that this
characteristic may be utilised far more effectively than the
cruel kurbash. Ethnology has many such lessons to teach.</p>

Dafina?' il me r&eacute;pondait invariablement, '<i>Je suis Mand&eacute;</i>.' C'est pourquoi, dans le
cours de ma relation, j'ai toujours d&eacute;sign&eacute; ce peuple par le nom de <i>Mand&eacute;</i>, qui est
son vrai nom." (L. G. Binger, <i>Du Niger au Golfe de Guin&eacute;e</i>, 1892, Vol. <small>II</small>. p. 373.)
At p. 375 this authority gives the following subdivisions of the Mand&eacute; family,
named from their respective <i>tenn&eacute;</i> (idol, fetish, totem):
</p><p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. <i>Bamba</i>, the crocodile: <i>Bammana</i>, not <i>Bambara</i>, which means kafir or
infidel, and is applied only to the non-Moslem Mand&eacute; groups.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. <i>Mali</i>, the hippopotamus: <i>Mali'nk&eacute;</i>, including the Kagoros and the Tagwas.
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. <i>Sama</i>, the elephant: <i>Sama'nk&eacute;</i>.
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. <i>Sa</i>, the snake: <i>Sa-mokho</i>.
</p><p>
Of each there are several sub-groups, while the surrounding peoples call them
all collectively <i>Wakor&eacute;</i>, <i>Wangara</i>, <i>Sakhersi</i>, and especially <i>Diula</i>. Attention to
this point will save the reader much confusion in consulting Barth, Cailli&eacute;, and
other early books of travel.</p></div>

inhabitants of Aujila from a relatively ancient period" (<small>IV.</small> p. 426). Barth, therefore,
does not bring the people themselves, or their language, from Egypt, but only
some of their institutions, and that indirectly through the Aujila Oasis in Cyrenaica,
and it may be added that this intercourse with Aujila appears to date only from
about 1150 <small>A.D.</small> (<small>IV.</small> p. 585).</p></div>

with the Semitic or the Hamitic family, or in an independent group by itself, and
it must be admitted that some of its features are extremely puzzling. While
Sudanese Negro in phonology and perhaps in most of its word roots, it is Hamitic
in its grammatical features and pronouns. But the Hamitic element is thought
by experts to be as much Kushite, or even Koptic, as Libyan. "On the whole, it
seems probable," says H. H. Johnston, "that the Hausa speech was shaped by a
double influence: from Egypt, and Hamiticized Nubia, as well as by Libyan
immigrants from across the Sahara." "A Survey of the Ethnography of Africa,"

the Kanuri and the Hausa peoples; "Here we took leave of Hausa with its fine
and beautiful country, and its cheerful and industrious population. It is remarkable
what a difference there is between the character of the ba-Haushe and the
Kanuri&mdash;the former lively, spirited, and cheerful, the latter melancholic, dejected,
and brutal; and the same difference is visible in their physiognomies&mdash;the former
having in general very pleasant and regular features, and more graceful forms,
while the Kanuri, with his broad face, his wide nostrils and his large bones, makes
a far less agreeable impression, especially the women, who are very plain and
certainly among the ugliest in all Negroland" (<small>II.</small> pp. 163-4).</p></div>

whose ethnical position so much doubt still prevails. Strange to say, they themselves
claim to be Arabs, and the claim is allowed by their neighbours, although
they are not Muhammadans. Lejean thinks they are Tibus from the north-west,
while Nachtigal, who met some as far west as Kanem, concluded from their appearance
and speech that they were really Arabs settled for hundreds of years in the
country (<i>op. cit.</i> <small>II.</small> p. 256).</p></div>

case of the Kababish and indicates the probable admixture of Negro, Mediterranean,
Hamite and other strains in the Sudanese Arabs. He says, "Among the
more settled tribes any important sheikh or faki can produce a table of his
ancestors (<i>i.e.</i> a <i>nisba</i>) in support of his asseverations.... I asked a village sheikh if
he could show me his pedigree, as I did not know from which of the exalted
sources his particular tribe claimed descent. He replied that he did not know
yet, but that his village had subscribed 60 piastres the month before to hire a faki
to compose a <i>nisba</i> for them, and that he would show me the result when it was
finished." "The Kababish: Some Remarks on the Ethnology of a Sudan Arab

whom they were reduced about 1700 <small>B.C.</small> In a later inscription of Rameses II
at Karnak (1400 <small>B.C.</small>) occurs the form <i>Beraberata</i>, name of a southern people
conquered by him. Hence Brugsch (<i>Reisebericht aus &AElig;gypten</i>, pp. 127 and 155) is
inclined to regard the modern <i>Barabra</i> as a true ethnical name confused in
classical times with the Greek and Roman <i>Barbarus</i>, but revived in its proper
sense since the Moslem conquest. See also the editorial note on the term <i>Berber</i>,

surprising to learn from the ill-starred B&ograve;ttego-Grixoni expedition of 1892-3 that
anthropophagy is still rife even in Gallaland, and amongst the white ("floridi")
Cormoso Gallas. Like the Fans, these prefer the meat "high," and it would
appear that all the dead are eaten. Hence in their country B&ograve;ttego found no
graves, and one of his native guides explained that "questa gente seppellisce i suoi

<p>In ethnology the only intelligible definition of a Bantu is
a full-blood or a half-blood Negro of Bantu speech<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>; and from
the physical standpoint no very hard and fast line can be
drawn between the northern Sudanese and southern Bantu
groups, considered as two ethnical units.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sudanese-Bantu
Divide.</div>

<p>Thanks to recent political developments in the interior,
the linguistic divide may now be traced with some accuracy
right across the continent. In the extreme
west, Sir H. H. Johnston has shown that it
coincides with the lower course of the Rio del
Rey, while farther east the French expedition of 1891 under
M. Dybowski found that it ran at about the same parallel
(5&deg; N.) along the elevated plateau which here forms the
water-parting between the Congo and the Chad basin. From
this point the line takes a south-easterly trend along the
southern borders of the Zandeh and Mangbattu territories to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
the Semliki Valley between Lakes Albert Edward and Albert
Nyanza, near the equator. Thence it pursues a somewhat
irregular course, first north by the east side of the Albert
Nyanza to the mouth of the Somerset Nile, then up that
river to Mruli and round the east side of Usoga and the
Victoria Nyanza to Kavirondo Bay, where it turns nearly east
to the sources of the Tana, and down that river to its mouth
in the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>At some points the line traverses debatable territory, as
in the Semliki Valley, where there are Sudanese and Negrillo
overlappings, and again beyond Victoria Nyanza, where the
frontiers are broken by the Hamitic Masai nomads and their
Wandorobbo allies. But, speaking generally, everything
south of the line here traced is Bantu, everything north of it
Sudanese Negro in the western and central regions, and
Hamitic in the eastern section between Victoria Nyanza and
the Indian Ocean.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Frontier
Tribes&mdash;The
Bonjo
Cannibals.</div>

<p>In some districts the demarcation is not quite distinct, as
in the Tana basin, where some of the Galla and Somali
Hamites from the north have encroached on the
territory of the Wa-Pokomo Bantus on the
south side of the river. But on the central
plateau M. Dybowski passed abruptly from the
territory of the Bonjos, northernmost of the Bantu tribes, to
that of the Sudanese Bandziri, a branch of the widespread
Zandeh people. In this region, about the crest of the Congo-Chad
water-parting, the contrasts appear to be all in favour
of the Sudanese and against the Bantus, probably because
here the former are Negroids, the latter full-blood Negroes.
Thus Dybowski<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> found the Bonjos to be a distinctly Negro
tribe with pronounced prognathism, and altogether a rude,
savage people, trading chiefly in slaves, who are fattened for
the meat market, and when in good condition will fetch about
twelve shillings. On the other hand the Bandziri, despite
their Niam-Niam connection, are not cannibals, but a peaceful,
agricultural people, friendly to travellers, and of a
coppery-brown complexion, with regular features, hence
perhaps akin to the light-coloured people met by Barth in
the Mosgu country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Baya
Nation.</div>

<p>Possibly the Bonjos may be a degraded branch of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span><i>Bayas</i> or <i>Nderes</i>, a large nation, with many subdivisions
widely diffused throughout the Sangha basin,
where they occupy the whole space between the
Kadei and the Mambere affluents of the main
stream (3&deg; to 7&deg; 30' N.; 14&deg; to 17&deg; E.). They are described
by M. F. J. Clozel<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> as of tall stature, muscular, well-proportioned,
with flat nose, slightly tumid lips, and of black colour,
but with a dash of copper-red in the upper classes. Although
cannibals, like the Bonjos, they are in other respects an
intelligent, friendly people, who, under the influence of the
Muhammadan Fulahs, have developed a complete political
administration, with a Royal Court, a Chancellor, Speaker,
Interpreter, and other officials, bearing sonorous titles taken
chiefly from the Hausa language. Their own Bantu tongue
is widespread and spoken with slight dialectic differences as
far as the Nana affluents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A "Red
People."</div>

<p>M. Clozel, who regards them as mentally and morally
superior to most of the Middle and Lower Congo tribes, tells
us that the Bayas, that is, the "Red People,"
came at an unknown period from the east,
"yielding to that great movement of migration
by which the African populations are continually impelled
westwards." The Yangere section were still on the move
some twelve years ago, but the general migration has since
been arrested by the Fulahs of Adamawa. Human flesh is
now interdicted to the women; they have domesticated the
sheep, goat, and dog, and believe in a supreme being called
<i>So</i>, whose powers are manifested in the dense woodlands,
while minor deities preside over the village and the hut, that
is, the whole community and each separate family group.
Thus both their religious and political systems present a
certain completeness, which recalls those prevalent amongst
the semi-civilised peoples of the equatorial lake region, and is
evidently due to the same cause&mdash;long contact or association
with a race of higher culture and intelligence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The North-East
Door to
Bantuland.</div>

<p>In order to understand all these relations, as well as
the general constitution of the Bantu populations, we have
to consider that the already-described Black
Zone, running from the Atlantic seaboard eastwards,
has for countless generations been almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
everywhere arrested north of the equator by the White Nile.
Probably since the close of the Old Stone Age the whole of
the region between the main stream and the Red Sea, and
from the equator north to the Mediterranean, has formed an
integral part of the Hamitic domain, encroached upon in
prehistoric times by Semites and others in Egypt and
Abyssinia, and in historic times chiefly by Semites (Arabs)
in Egypt, Upper Nubia, Senaar, and Somaliland. Between
this region and Africa south of the equator there are no
serious physical obstructions of any kind, whereas farther
west the Hamitic Saharan nomads were everywhere barred
access to the south by the broad, thickly-peopled plateaux of
the Sudanese Black Zone. All encroachments on this side
necessarily resulted in absorption in the multitudinous Negro
populations of Central Sudan, with the modifications of the
physical and mental characters which are now presented by
the Kanuri, Hausas, Songhai and other Negroid nations of
that region, and are at present actually in progress amongst
the conquering Fulah Hamites scattered in small dominant
groups over a great part of Sudan from Senegambia to
Wadai.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Semitic Elements
of the
Bantu Amalgam.</div>

<p>It follows that the leavening element, by which the
southern Negro populations have been diversely modified
throughout the Bantu lands, could have been
drawn only from the Hamitic and Semitic
peoples of the north-east. But in this connection
the Semites themselves must be considered
as almost <i>une quantit&eacute; n&eacute;gligeable</i>, partly because of their
relatively later arrival from Asia, and partly because, as they
arrived, they became largely assimilated to the indigenous
Hamitic inhabitants of Egypt, Abyssinia, and Somaliland.
Belief in the presence of a Semitic people in the interior
of S.E. Africa in early historic times was supported by the
groups of ruins (especially those of Zimbabwe), found mainly
in Southern Rhodesia, described in J. T. Bent's <i>Ruined Cities
of Mashonaland</i>. Exploration in 1905 dispelled the romance
hitherto connected with the "temples" and produced evidence
to show that they were not earlier in date than the fourteenth
or fifteenth centuries and were of native construction<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
probably served as distributing centres for the gold traffic
carried on with the Semitic traders of the coast. For certainly
in Muhammadan times Semites from Arabia formed
permanent settlements along the eastern seaboard as far
south as Sofala, and these intermingled more freely with the
converted coast peoples (<i>Wa-Swahili</i>, from <i>sahel</i> = "coast"),
but not with the <i>Kafirs</i>, or "Unbelievers," farther south and
in the interior. In our own days these Swahili half-breeds,
with a limited number of full-blood Arabs<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>, have penetrated
beyond the Great Lakes to the Upper and Middle Congo
basin, but rather as slave-hunters and destroyers than as
peaceful settlers, and contracting few alliances, except perhaps
amongst the Wa-Yao and Ma-Gwangara tribes of Mozambique,
and the cannibal Ma-Nyemas farther inland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Malay
Elements in
Madagascar
only.</div>

<p>To this extent Semitism may be recognised as a factor in
the constituent elements of the Bantu populations. Malays
have also been mentioned, and some ethnologists
have even brought the Fulahs of Western
Sudan all the way from Malaysia. Certainly if
they reached and formed settlements in Madagascar,
there is no intrinsic reason why they should not have
done the same on the mainland. But I have failed to find
any evidence of the fact, and if they ever at any time established
themselves on the east coast they have long disappeared,
without leaving any clear trace of their presence either in the
physical appearance, speech, usages or industries of the
aborigines, such as are everywhere conspicuous in Madagascar.
The small canoes with two booms and double outriggers
which occur at least from Mombasa to Mozambique
are of Indonesian origin, as are the fish traps that occur at
Mombasa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hamitic
Element
everywhere.</div>

<p>There remain the north-eastern Hamites, and especially
the Galla branch, as the essential extraneous factor in this
obscure Bantu problem. To the stream of migration
described by M. Clozel as setting east
and west, corresponds another and an older
stream, which ages ago took a southerly direction along the
eastern seaboard to the extremity of the continent, where
are now settled the Zulu-Xosa nations, almost more Hamites
than Negroes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Ba-Himas.</div>

<p>The impulse to two such divergent movements could have
come only from the north-east, where we still find the same
tendencies in actual operation. During his exploration of the
east equatorial lands, Capt. Speke had already observed that
the rulers of the Bantu nations about the Great Lakes
(Karagwe, Ba-Ganda, Ba-Nyoro, etc.) all belonged
to the same race, known by the name of
<i>Ba-Hima</i>, that is, "Northmen," a pastoral people of fine
appearance, who were evidently of Galla stock, and had
come originally from Gallaland. Since then Schuver found
that the Negroes of the Afilo country are governed by a
Galla aristocracy<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>, and we now know that several Ba-hima
communities bearing different names live interspersed amongst
the mixed Bantu nations of the lacustrian plateaux as far
south as Lake Tanganyika and Unyamweziland<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>. Here the
Wa-Tusi, Wa-Hha, and Wa-Ruanda are or were all of the
same Hamitic type, and M. Lionel D&egrave;cle "was very much
struck by the extraordinary difference that is to be found
between them and their Bantu neighbours<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>." Then this
observer adds: "Pure types are not common, and are only
to be found amongst the aristocracy, if I may use such an
expression for Africans. The mass of the people have lost
their original type through intermixture with neighbouring
tribes."</p>

<p>J. Roscoe<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> thus describes the inhabitants of Ankole.
"The pastoral people are commonly called Bahima, though
they prefer to be called Banyankole; they are a tall fine race
though physically not very strong. Many of them are over
six feet in height, their young king being six feet six inches
and broad in proportion to his height.... It is not only the
men who are so tall, the women also being above the usual
stature of their sex among other tribes, though they do injustice
to their height by a fashionable stoop which makes
them appear much shorter than they really are. The features<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of these pastoral people are good: they have straight noses
with a bridge, thin lips, finely chiselled faces, heads well set
on fairly developed frames, and a good carriage; there is in
fact nothing but their colour and their short woolly hair to
make you think of them as negroids."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pastoral and
Agricultural
Clans.</div>

<p>The contrast and the relationship between the pastoral
conquerors and the agricultural tribes is clearly seen among
the Ba-Nyoro. "The pastoral people are a tall,
well-built race of men and women with finely
cut features, many of them over six feet in
height. The men are athletic with little spare flesh, but the
women are frequently very fat and corpulent: indeed their
ideal of beauty is obesity, and their milk diet together with
their careful avoidance of exercise tends to increase their
size. The agricultural clans, on the other hand, are short,
ill-favoured looking men and women with broad noses of the
negro type, lean and unkempt. Both classes are dark, varying
in shade from a light brown to deep black, with short woolly
hair. The pastoral people refrain, as far as possible, from all
manual labour and expect the agricultural clans to do their
menial work for them, such as building their houses, carrying
firewood and water, and supplying them with grain and beer
for their households." "Careful observation and enquiry
lead to the opinion that the agricultural clans were the original
inhabitants and that they were conquered by the pastoral
people who have reduced them to their present servile
condition<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bantus
mainly a Negro-Hamitic
Cross.</div>

<p>From these indications and many others that might easily
be adduced, it may be concluded with some confidence that
the great mass of the Bantu populations are
essentially Negroes, leavened in diverse proportions,
for the most part by conquering Galla
or Hamitic elements percolating for thousands of generations
from the north-eastern section of the Hamitic domain into the
heart of Bantuland.</p>

<p>The date of the Bantu migrations is much disputed. "As
far as linguistic evidence goes," says H. H. Johnston<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>, "the
ancestors of the Bantu dwelt in some region like the Bahr-al-Ghazal,
not far from the Mountain Nile on the east, from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Kordofan on the north, or the Benue and Chad basins on the
west. Their first great movement of expansion seems to
have been eastward, and to have established them (possibly
with a guiding aristocracy of Hamitic origin) in the region
between Mount Elgon, the Northern Victoria Nyanza,
Tanganyika, and the Congo Forest. At some such period
as about 300 <small>B.C.</small> their far-reaching invasion of Central and
South Africa seems to have begun." The date is fixed by
the date of the introduction of the fowl from Nile-land, since
the root word for fowl is the same almost throughout Bantu
Africa, "obviously related to the Persian words for fowl, yet
quite unrelated to the Semitic terms, or to those used by the
Kushites of Eastern Africa." F. Stuhlmann, on the contrary,
places the migrations practically in geological times. After
bringing the Sudan Negroes from South Asia at the end of
the Tertiary or beginning of the Pleistocene (<i>Pluvialperiod</i>),
and the Proto-Hamites from a region probably somewhat
further to the north and west of the former, he continues:
From the mingling of the Negroes and the Proto-Hamites
were formed, probably in East Africa, the Bantu languages
and the Bantu peoples, who wandered thence south and
west. The wanderings began in the latter part of the Pleistocene
period<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>. He quotes Th. Arldt, who with greater
precision places the occupation of Africa by the Negroes
in the Riss period (300,000 years ago) and that of the
Hamites in the Mousterian period (30,000 to 50,000 years
ago)<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>.</p>

<p>All these peoples resulting from the crossings of Negroes
with Hamites now speak various forms of the same organic
Bantu mother-tongue. But this linguistic uniformity is strictly
analogous to that now prevailing amongst the multifarious
peoples of Aryan speech in Eurasia, and is due to analogous
causes&mdash;the diffusion in extremely remote times of a mixed
Hamito-Negro people of Bantu speech in Africa south of the
equator. It might perhaps be objected that the present
Ba-Hima pastors are of Hamitic speech, because we know
from Stanley that the late king M'tesa of Buganda was proud
of his Galla ancestors, whose language he still spoke as his
mother-tongue. But he also spoke Luganda, and every echo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
of Galla speech has already died out amongst most of the
Ba-Hima communities in the equatorial regions. So it was
with what I may call the "Proto-Ba-Himas," the first conquering
Galla tribes, Schuver's and D&egrave;cle's "aristocracy,"
who were gradually blended with the aborigines in a new and
superior nationality of Bantu speech, because "there are
many mixed races, ... but there are no mixed languages<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lacustrians.</div>

<p>These views are confirmed by the traditions and folklore
still current amongst the "Lacustrians," as the great nations
may be called, who are now grouped round about the shores
of Lakes Victoria and Albert Nyanza. At present, or rather
before the recent extension of the British
administration to East Central Africa, these
peoples were constituted in a number of separate
kingdoms, the most powerful of which were Buganda
(Uganda)<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>, Bunyoro (Unyoro), and Karagwe. But they
remember a time when all these now scattered fragments
formed parts of a mighty monarchy, the vast Kitwara Empire,
which comprised the whole of the lake-studded plateau between
the Ruwenzori range and Kavirondoland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their Traditions&mdash;The
Kintu Legend.</div>

<p>The story is differently told in the different states, each
nation being eager to twist it to its own glorification; but all
are agreed that the founder of the empire was
Kintu, "The Blameless," at once priest, patriarch
and ruler of the land, who came from the north
hundreds of years ago, with one wife, one cow, one goat, one
sheep, one chicken, one banana-root, and one sweet potato.
At first all was waste, an uninhabited wilderness, but it was
soon miraculously peopled, stocked, and planted with what he
had brought with him, the potato being apportioned to
Bunyoro, the banana to Buganda, and these form the staple
food of those lands to this day.</p>

<p>Then the people waxed wicked, and Kintu, weary of their
evil ways and daily bloodshed, took the original wife, cow,
and other things, and went away in the night and was seen
no more. But nobody believed him dead, and a long line of
his mythical successors appear to have spent the time they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
could spare from strife and war and evil deeds in looking for
the lost Kintu. Kimera, one of these, was a mighty giant
of such strength and weight that he left his footprints on the
rocks where he trod, as may still be seen on a cliff not far
from Ulagalla, the old capital of Buganda. There was also
a magician, Kibaga, who could fly aloft and kill the Ba-Nyoro
people (this is the Buganda version) by hurling stones
down upon them, and for his services received in marriage a
beautiful Ba-Nyoro captive, who, another Delilah, found out
his secret, and betrayed him to her people.</p>

<p>At last came King Ma'anda, who pretended to be a great
hunter, but it was only to roam the woodlands in search of
Kintu, and thus have tidings of him. One day a peasant,
obeying the directions of a thrice-dreamt dream, came to a
place in the forest, where was an aged man on a throne
between two rows of armed warriors, seated on mats, his long
beard white with age, and all his men fair as white people
and clothed in white robes. Then Kintu, for it was he, bid
the peasant hasten to summon Ma'anda thither, but only with
his mother and the messenger. At the Court Ma'anda
recognised the stranger whom he had that very night seen in
a dream, and so believed his words and at once set out with
his mother and the peasant. But the Katikiro, or Prime
Minister, through whom the message had been delivered to
the king, fearing treachery, also started on their track, keeping
them just in view till the trysting-place was reached. But
Kintu, who knew everything, saw him all the time, and when
he came forward on finding himself discovered the enraged
Ma'anda pierced his faithful minister to the heart and he fell
dead with a shriek. Thereupon Kintu and his seated warriors
instantly vanished, and the king with the others wept and
cried upon Kintu till the deep woods echoed Kintu, Kintu-u,
Kintu-u-u. But the blood-hating Kintu was gone, and to
this day has never again been seen or heard of by any man
in Buganda. The references to the north and to Kintu and
his ghostly warriors "fair as white people" need no comment<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>.
It is noteworthy that in some of the Nyassaland<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
dialects <i>Kintu</i> (<i>Caintu</i>) alternates with <i>Mulungu</i> as the
name of the Supreme Being, the great ancestor of the
tribe<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Ba-Ganda,
past and
present.</div>

<p>Then follows more traditional or legendary matter, including
an account of the wars with the fierce Wakedi, who
wore iron armour, until authentic history is
reached with the atrocious Suna II (1836-60),
father of the scarcely less atrocious M'tesa.
After his death in 1884 Buganda and the neighbouring
states passed rapidly through a series of astonishing political,
religious, and social vicissitudes, resulting in the present <i>pax
Britannica</i>, and the conversion of large numbers, some to
Isl&aacute;m, others to one form or another of Christianity. At times
it might have been difficult to see much religion in the ferocity
of the contending factions; but since the establishment of
harmony by the secular arm, real progress has been made, and
the Ba-Ganda especially have displayed a remarkable capacity
as well as eagerness to acquire a knowledge of letters and of
religious principles, both in the Protestant and the Roman
Catholic communities. Printing-presses, busily worked by
native hands, are needed to meet the steadily increasing
demand for a vernacular literature, in a region where blood
had flowed continually from the disappearance of "Kintu"
till the British occupation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Political and
Social
Institutions.</div>

<p>To the admixture of the Hamitic and Negro elements
amongst the Lacustrians may perhaps be attributed the
curious blend of primitive and higher institutions
in these communities. At the head of the State
was a Kabaka, king or emperor, although the
title was also borne by the queen-mother and the queen-sister.
This autocrat had his <i>Lukiko</i>, or Council, of which the
members were the <i>Katikiro</i>, Prime Minister and Chief Justice,
the <i>Kimbugwe</i>, who had charge of the King's umbilical cord,
and held rank next to the <i>Katikiro</i>, and ten District chiefs,
for the administration of the ten large districts into which the
country was divided, each rendering accounts to the <i>Katikiro</i>
and through him to the King. Each District chief had to
maintain in good order a road some four yards wide, reaching
from the capital to his country seat, a distance possibly of
nearly 100 miles. Each District chief had sub-chiefs under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
him, independent of the chief in managing their own portion of
land. These were responsible for keeping in repair the road
between their own residence and that of the District chief.
In each district was a supreme court, and every sub-chief,
even with only a dozen followers, could hold a court and try
cases among his own people. The people, however, could
take their cases from one court to another until eventually
they came before the <i>Katikiro</i> or the King.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Totemic
System.</div>

<p>Yet together with this highly advanced social and political
development a totemic exogamous clan system was in force
throughout Uganda, all the Ba-Ganda belonging
to one of 29 <i>kika</i> or clans, each possessing
two totems held sacred by the clan. Thus the
Lion (<i>Mpologoma</i>) clan had the Eagle (<i>Mpungu</i>) for its second
totem; the Mushroom (<i>Butiko</i>) clan had the Snail (<i>Nsonko</i>);
the Buffalo (<i>Mbogo</i>) clan had a New Cooking Pot (<i>Ntamu</i>).
Each clan had its chief, or Father, who resided on the clan
estate which was also the clan burial-ground, and was responsible
for the conduct of the members of his branch. All
the clans were exogamous<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>, and a man was expected to take
a second wife from the clan of his paternal grandmother<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bantu Peoples

<p>No direct relations appear to exist between the Lacustrians

between the Tana, north-east frontier of Bantuland,
and the southern slopes of Kilimanjaro.
Their affinities seem to be rather with the <i>Wa-Nyika</i>, <i>Wa-Boni</i>,
<i>Wa-Duruma</i>, <i>Wa-Giryama</i>, and the other coast tribes between
the Tana and Mombasa. All of these tribes have more or
less adopted the habits and customs of the Masai.</p>

<p>We learn from Sir A. Harding<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> that in the British East<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
African Protectorate there are altogether as many as twenty-five
distinct tribes, generally at a low stage of culture, with a
loose tribal organisation, a fully-developed totemic system,
and a universal faith in magic; but there are no priests, idols
or temples, or even distinctly recognised hereditary chiefs or
communal councils. The Gallas, who have crossed the Tana
and here encroached on Bantu territory, have reminiscences
of a higher civilisation and apparently of Christian traditions
and observances, derived no doubt from Abyssinia. They
tell you that they had once a sacred book, the observance of
whose precepts made them the first of nations. But it was
left lying about, and so got eaten by a cow, and since then
when cows are killed their entrails are carefully searched for
the lost volume.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The

W. E. Taylor<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>, and W. W. A. Fitzgerald<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>. Here again
Bantus and Gallas are found in close contact, and we
learn that the Wa-Giryama, who came originally from the
Mount Mangea district in the north-east, occupied their
present homes only about a century ago "upon the withdrawal
of the Gallas." The language, which is of a somewhat
archaic type, appears to be the chief member of a widespread
Bantu group, embracing the Ki-nyika, and Ki-pokomo in the
extreme north, the Ki-swahili of the Zanzibar
coast, and perhaps the Ki-kamba, the Ki-teita,
and others of the interior between the coastlands
and Victoria Nyanza. These inland tongues, however, have
greatly diverged from the primitive Ki-giryama<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>, which stands
in somewhat the same relation to them and to the still more
degraded and Arabised Ki-swahili<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> that Latin stands to the

<div class="sidenote">Mulungu and
the Shades.</div>

<p>But the chief interest presented by the Wa-Giryama is
centred in their religious ideas, which are mainly connected
with ancestry-worship, and afford an unexpected
insight into the origin and nature of that perhaps
most primitive of all forms of belief. There is,
of course, a vague entity called a "Supreme Being" in ethnographic
writings, who, like the Algonquian Manitu, crops up
under various names (here <i>Mulungu</i>) all over east Bantuland,
but on analysis generally resolves itself into some dim notion
growing out of ancestry-worship, a great or aged person,
eponymous hero or the like, later deified in diverse ways
as the Preserver, the Disposer, and especially the Creator.
These Wa-Giryama suppose that from his union
with the Earth all things have sprung, and that
human beings are Mulungu's hens and chickens.
But there is also an idea that he may be the manes of their
fathers, and thus everything becomes merged in a kind of
apotheosis of the departed. They think "the disembodied
spirit is powerful for good and evil.  Individuals worship the
shades of their immediate ancestors or elder relatives; and
the <i>k'omas</i> [souls?] of the whole nation are worshipped on
public occasions."</p>

<p>Although the European ghost or "revenant" is unknown,
the spirits of near ancestors may appear in dreams, and
express their wishes to the living. They ask for sacrifices at
their graves to appease their hunger, and such sacrifices are
often made with a little flour and water poured into a coconut
shell let into the ground, the fowls and other victims being so
killed that the blood shall trickle into the grave. At the
offering the dead are called on by name to come and partake,
and bring their friends with them, who are also mentioned by
name. But whereas Christians pray to be remembered of
heaven and the saints, the Wa-Giryama pray rather that the
new-born babe be forgotten of Mulungu, and so live. "Well!"
they will say on the news of a birth, "may Mulungu forget
him that he may become strong and well." This is an
instructive trait, a reminiscence of the time when Mulungu,
now almost harmless or indifferent to mundane things, was the
embodiment of all evil, hence to be feared and appeased in
accordance with the old dictum <i>Timor fecit deos</i>.</p>

<p>At present no distinction is drawn between good and bad
spirits, but all are looked upon as, of course, often, though not
always, more powerful than the living, but still human beings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
subject to the same feelings, passions, and fancies as they are.
Some are even poor weaklings on whom offerings are wasted.
"The Shade of So-and-so's father is of no use at all; it has
finished up his property, and yet he is no better," was a
native's comment on the result of a series of sacrifices a man
had vainly made to his father's shade to regain his health.
They may also be duped and tricked, and when <i>pombe</i> (beer)
is a-brewing, some is poured out on the graves of the dead,
with the prayer that they may drink, and when drunk fall
asleep, and so not disturb the living with their brawls and
bickerings, just like the wrangling fairies in <i>A Midsummer
Night's Dream</i><a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Wa-Swahili.</div>

<p>Far removed from such crass anthropomorphism, but not
morally much improved, are the kindred Wa-Swahili, who by
long contact and interminglings have become
largely Arabised in dress, religion, and general
culture. They are graphically described by
Taylor as "a seafaring, barter-loving race of slave-holders and
slave-traders, strewn in a thin line along a thousand miles of
creeks and islands; inhabitants of a coast that has witnessed
incessant political changes, and a succession of monarchical
dynasties in various centres; receiving into their midst for
ages past a continuous stream of strange blood, consisting not
only of serviles from the interior, but of immigrants from
Persia, Arabia, and Western India; men that have come to
live, and often to die, as resident aliens, leaving in many cases
a hybrid progeny. Of one section of these immigrants&mdash;the
Arabs&mdash;the religion has become the master-religion of the
land, overspreading, if not entirely supplanting, the old Bantu
ancestor-worship, and profoundly affecting the whole family
life."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Zang
Empire.</div>

<p>The Wa-Swahili are in a sense a historical people, for
they formed the chief constituent elements of the renowned
Zang (Zeng) empire<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>, which in Edrisi's time

from Somaliland to and beyond the Zambesi.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
When the Portuguese burst suddenly into the Indian Ocean it
was a great and powerful state, or rather a vast confederacy
of states, with many flourishing cities&mdash;Magdoshu, Brava,
Mombasa, Melindi, Kilwa, Angosha, Sofala&mdash;and widespread
commercial relations extending across the eastern waters to
India and China, and up the Red Sea to Europe. How these
great centres of trade and eastern culture were one after the
other ruthlessly destroyed by the Portuguese corsairs <i>co' o
ferro e fogo</i> ("with sword and fire," Camoens) is told by
Duarte Barbosa, who was himself a Portuguese and an eyewitness
of the havoc and the horrors that not infrequently
followed in the trail of his barbarous fellow-countrymen<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Zulu-Xosas.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Former and
Present
Domain.</div>

<p>Beyond Sofala we enter the domain of the <i>Ama-Zulu</i>, the
<i>Ama-Xosa</i>, and others whom I have collectively called <i>Zulu-Xosas</i><a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>,
and who are in some respects the most
remarkable ethnical group in all Bantuland.
Indeed they are by common consent regarded
as Bantus in a preeminent sense, and this conventional term
<i>Bantu</i> itself is taken from their typical Bantu language<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>.
There is clear evidence that they are comparatively recent
arrivals, necessarily from the north, in their present territory,
which was still occupied by Bushman and Hottentot tribes
probably within the last thousand years or so.  Before the
Kafir wars with the English (1811-77) this
territory extended much farther round the coast
than at present, and for many years the Great
Kei River has formed the frontier between the white settlements
and the Xosas.</p>

<p>But what they have lost in this direction the Zulu-Xosas,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
or at least the Zulus, have recovered a hundredfold by their
expansion northwards during the nineteenth century. After
the establishment of the Zulu military power under Dingiswayo
and his successor Chaka (1793-1828), half the continent was
overrun by organised Zulu hordes, who ranged as far north as
Victoria Nyanza, and in many places founded more or less
unstable kingdoms or chieftaincies on the model of the terrible
despotism set up in Zululand. Such were, beyond the
Limpopo, the states of Gazaland and Matabililand, the latter
established about 1838 by Umsilikatzi, father of Lobengula,
who perished in a hopeless struggle with the English in 1894.
Gungunhana, last of the Swazi (Zulu) chiefs in Gazaland,
where the A-Ngoni had overrun the Ba-Thonga (Ba-Ronga)<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>,
was similarly dispossessed by the Portuguese in 1896.</p>

<p>North of Zambesi the Zulu bands&mdash;Ma-Situ, Ma-Viti,
Ma-Ngoni (A-Ngoni), and others&mdash;nowhere developed large
political states except for a short time under the ubiquitous
Mirambo in Unyamweziland. But some, especially the
A-Ngoni<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>, were long troublesome in the Nyasa district, and
others about the Lower Zambesi, where they are known to
the Portuguese as "Landins." The A-Ngoni power was
finally broken by the English early in 1898, and the reflux
movement has now entirely subsided, and cannot be revived,
the disturbing elements having been extinguished at the
fountain-head by the absorption of Zululand itself in the
British Colony of Natal (1895).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zulu-Xosa
Genealogies.</div>

<p>Nowhere have patriarchal institutions been more highly
developed than among the Zulu-Xosas, all of whom, except
perhaps the Ama-Fingus and some other broken
groups, claim direct descent from some eponymous
hero or mythical founder of the tribe. Thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
in the national traditions Chaka was seventh in descent from
a legendary chief Zulu, from whom they take the name of
<i>Abantu ba-Kwa-Zulu</i>, that is "People of Zulu's Land,"
although the true mother-tribe appear to have been the now
extinct Ama-Ntombela. Once the supremacy and prestige
of Chaka's tribe were established, all the others, as they were
successively reduced, claimed also to be true Zulus, and as
the same process went on in the far north, the term Zulu has
now in many cases come to imply political rather than blood
relationship. Here we have an object lesson, by which the
ethnical value of such names as "Aryan," "Kelt," "Briton,"
"Slav," etc. may be gauged in other regions.</p>

<p>So also most of the southern section claim as their founder
and ancestor a certain <i>Xosa</i>, sprung from Zuide, who may
have flourished about 1500, and whom the Ama-Tembus and
Ama-Mpondos also regard as their progenitor. Thus the
whole section is connected, but not in the direct line, with the
Xosas, who trace their lineage from Galeka and Khakhabe,
sons of Palo, who is said to have died about 1780, and was
himself tenth in direct descent from Xosa. We thus get
a genealogical table as under, which gives his proper place in
the Family Tree to nearly every historical "Kafir" chief in
Cape Colony, where ignorance of these relations caused much
bloodshed during the early Kafir wars:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physical Type.</div>

<p>But all, both northern Zulus and southern Xosas, are
essentially one people in speech, physique, usages and social
institutions. The hair is uniformly of a somewhat
frizzly texture, the colour of a light or clear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
brown amongst the Ama-Tembus, but elsewhere very dark,
the Swazis being almost "blue-black"; the head decidedly
long (72.5) and high (195.8); nose variable, both Negroid and
perfectly regular; height above the mean 1.75 m. to 1.8 m.
(5 ft. 9 in. to 5 ft. 11 in.); figure shapely and muscular, though
Fritsch's measurements show that it is sometimes far from
the almost ideal standard of beauty with which some early
observers have credited them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Common

<p>Mentally the Zulu-Xosas stand much higher than the true
Negro, as shown especially in their political organisation,
which, before the development of Dingiswayo's
military system under European influences, was
a kind of patriarchal monarchy controlled by a
powerful aristocracy. The nation was grouped in tribes
connected by the ties of blood and ruled by the hereditary
<i>inkose</i>, or feudal chief, who was supreme, with power of life
and death, within his own jurisdiction. Against his mandates,
however, the nobles could protest in council, and it was in fact
their decisions that established precedents and the traditional
code of common law. "This common law is
well adapted to a people in a rude state of
society. It holds everyone accused of crime
guilty unless he can prove himself innocent; it makes the
head of the family responsible for the conduct of all its
branches, the village collectively for all resident in it, and the
clan for each of its villages. For the administration of the
law there are courts of various grades, from any of which an
appeal may be taken to the Supreme Council, presided over
by the paramount chief, who is not only the ruler but also the
father of the people<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ma-Shonas and
Ma-Kalakas.</div>

<p>In the interior, between the southern coast ranges and the
Zambesi, the Hottentot and Bushman aborigines were in
prehistoric ages almost everywhere displaced or
reduced to servitude by other Bantu peoples
such as the Ma-Kalakas and Ma-Shonas, the
Be-Chuanas and the kindred Ba-Sutos. Of these the first
arrivals (from the north) appear to have been the Ma-Shonas
and Ma-Kalakas, who were being slowly "eaten up" by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">The Monomotapa
Myth.</div>

<p>Both nations are industrious tillers of the soil, skilled in
metal-work and in mining operations, being probably the
direct descendants of the natives, whose great
chief <i>Monomotapa</i>, <i>i.e.</i> "Lord of the Mines," as
I interpret the word<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>, ruled over the Manica and
surrounding auriferous districts when the Portuguese first
reached Sofala early in the sixteenth century. Apparently
for political reasons<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> this Monomotapa was later transformed
by them from a monarch to a monarchy, the vast empire of
Monomotapaland, which was supposed to comprise pretty well
everything south of the Zambesi, but, having no existence,
has for the last two hundred years eluded the diligent search
of historical geographers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Zimbabwe
Ruins.</div>

<p>But some centuries before the arrival of the Portuguese
the Ma-Kalakas with the kindred Ba-Nyai, Ba-Senga and
others, may well have been at work in the mines of this
auriferous region, in the service of the builders
of the Zimbabwe ruins explored and described
by the late Theodore Bent<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>, and by him and
many others attributed to some ancient cultured people of
South Arabia. This theory of prehistoric Oriental origin was
supported by a calculation of the orientation of the Zimbabwe
"temple," by reports of inscriptions and emblems suggesting
"Phoenician rites," and by the discovery, during excavation,
of foreign objects. Later investigation, however, showed that
the orientation was based on inexact measurements; no
authentic inscriptions were found either at Zimbabwe or
elsewhere in connection with the ruins; none of the objects
discovered in the course of the excavations could be recognised
as more than a few centuries old, while those that were not
demonstrably foreign imports were of African type. In 1905
a scientific exploration of the ruins placed these facts beyond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
dispute. The medieval objects were found in such positions
as to be necessarily contemporaneous with the foundation of
the buildings, all of which could be attributed to the same
period. Finally it was established that the plan and construction
of Zimbabwe instead of being unique, as was
formerly supposed, only differed from other Rhodesian ruins
in dimensions and extent. The explorers felt confident that
the buildings were not earlier than the fourteenth or fifteenth
century <small>A.D.</small>, and that the builders were the Bantu people,
remains of whose stone-faced kraals are found at so many
places between the Limpopo and the Zambesi. Their conclusions,
however, have not met with universal acceptance<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Be-Chuanas.</div>

<p>With the Be-Chuanas, whose territory extends from the
Orange river to Lake Ngami and includes Basutoland with
a great part of the Transvaal, we again meet a people at the
totemic stage of culture. Here the eponymous
heroes of the Zulu-Xosas are replaced by
baboons, fishes, elephants, and other animals from which the
various tribal groups claim descent. The animal in question
is called the <i>siboko</i> of the tribe and is held in especial reverence,
members (as a rule) refraining from killing or eating it.
Many tribes take their name from their <i>siboko</i>, thus the
Ba-Tlapin, "they of the fish," Ba-Kuena, "they of the crocodile."
The <i>siboko</i> of the Ba-Rolong, who as a tribe are

<div class="sidenote">The Ba-Rotse
Empire.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Ma-Kololo
Episode.</div>

<p>With a section of the great Be-Chuana family, the Ba-Suto,
and the Ba-Rotse is connected one of the most remarkable
episodes in the turbulent history of the South
African peoples during the nineteenth century.
Many years ago an offshoot of the Ba-Rotse
migrated to the Middle Zambesi above the Victoria Falls,
where they founded a powerful state, the "Barotse (Marotse)
Empire," which despite a temporary eclipse
still exists as a British protectorate.  The
eclipse was caused by another migration northwards
of a great body of Ma-Kololo, a branch of the Ba-Suto,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
who under the renowned chief Sebituane reached the Zambesi
about 1835 and overthrew the Barotse dynasty, reducing
the natives to a state of servitude.</p>

<p>But after the death of Sebituane's successor, Livingstone's
Sekeletu, the Ba-Rotse, taking advantage of their oppressors'
dynastic rivalries, suddenly revolted, and after exterminating
the Ma-Kololo almost to the last man, reconstituted the
empire on a stronger footing than ever.  It now comprises an
area of some 250,000 square miles between the Chobe and
the Kafukwe affluents<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>, with a population vaguely estimated
at over 1,000,000, including the savage Ba-Shukulumbwe
tribes of the Kafukwe basin reduced in 1891<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>.</p>

<p>Yet, short as was the Ma-Kololo rule (1835-70), it was
long enough to impose their language on the vanquished
Ba-Rotse<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>.  Hence the curious phenomenon now witnessed
about the Middle Zambesi, where the Ma-Kololo have
disappeared, while their Sesuto speech remains the common
medium of intercourse throughout the Barotse empire. How
often have analogous shiftings and dislocations taken place in
the course of ages in other parts of the world! And in the
light of such lessons how cautious ethnographists should be in
arguing from speech to race, and drawing conclusions from
these or similar surface relations!</p>

<p>Referring to these stirring events, Mackenzie writes:
"Thus perished the Makololo from among the number of
South African tribes. No one can put his finger on the map
of Africa and say, 'Here dwell the Makololo<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>.'" This will
puzzle many who since the middle of the nineteenth century
have repeatedly heard of, and even been in unpleasantly close
contact with, Ma-Kololo so called, not indeed in Barotseland,
but lower down the Zambesi about its Shir&eacute; affluent.</p>

<p>The explanation of the seeming contradiction is given by
another incident, which is also not without ethnical significance.
From Livingstone's <i>Journals</i> we learn that in 1859
he was accompanied to the east coast by a small party of
Ma-Kololo and others, sent by his friend Sekeletu in quest of
a cure for leprosy, from which the emperor was suffering.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
These Ma-Kololo, hearing of the Ba-Rotse revolt, wisely
stopped on their return journey at the Shir&eacute; confluence, and
through the prestige of their name have here succeeded in
founding several so-called "Makololo States," which still exist,
and have from time to time given considerable trouble to the
administrators of British Central Africa. But how true are
Mackenzie's words, if the political be separated from the
ethnical relations, may be judged from the fact that of the
original founders of these petty Shir&eacute; states only two were
full-blood Ma-Kololo. All the others were, I believe,
Ba-Rotse, Ba-Toka, or Ba-Tonga, these akin to the savage
Ba-Shukulumbwe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death without
Extinction.</div>

<p>Thus the Ma-Kololo live on, in their speech above the
Victoria Falls, in their name below the Victoria Falls, and it
is only from history we know that since about
1870 the whole nation has been completely
wiped out everywhere in the Zambesi valley.
But even amongst cultured peoples history goes back a very
little way, 10,000 years at most anywhere. What changes
and shiftings may, therefore, have elsewhere also taken place
during prehistoric ages, all knowledge of which is now past
recovery<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spread of
Christianity
among the
Southern
Bantus.</div>

<p>Few Bantu peoples have lent a readier ear to the teachings
of Christian propagandists than the Xosa, Ba-Suto, and
Be-Chuana natives. Several stations in the heart of Kafirland&mdash;Blythswood,
Somerville, Lovedale, and others&mdash;have
for some time been self-supporting, and prejudice alone would
deny that they have worked for good amongst
the surrounding Gaika, Galeka, and Fingo tribes.
Sogo, a member of the Blythswood community,
has produced a translation of the <i>Pilgrim's
Progress</i>, described by J. Macdonald as "a
marvel of accuracy and lucidity of expression<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>"; numerous
village schools are eagerly attended, and much land has been
brought under intelligent cultivation.</p>

<p>The French and Swiss Protestant teachers have also
achieved great things in Basutoland, where they were
welcomed by Moshesh, the founder of the present Basuto
nation. The tribal system has yielded to a higher social<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
organisation, and the Ba-Tau, Ba-Puti, and several other
tribal groups have been merged in industrious pastoral and
agricultural communities professing a somewhat strict form of
Protestant Christianity, and entirely forgetful of the former
heathen practices associated with witchcraft and ancestry-worship.
Moshesh was one of the rare instances among the
Kafirs of a leader endowed with intellectual gifts which placed
him on a level with Europeans. He governed his people
wisely and well for nearly fifty years, and his life-work has left
a permanent mark on South African history<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Khama.</div>

<p>In Bechuanaland one great personality dominates the social
horizon. Khama, king of the Ba-Mangwato nation, next to
the Ba-Rotse the most powerful section of the
Be-Chuana, may be described as a true father
of his people, a Christian legislator in the better sense of the
term, and an enlightened reformer even from the secular point
of view.</p>

<p>When these triumphs, analogous to those witnessed
amongst the Lacustrians and in other parts of Bantuland,
are contrasted with the dull weight of resistance everywhere
opposed by the full-blood Negro populations to any progress
beyond their present low level of culture, we are the better
able to recognise the marked intellectual superiority of the
negroid Bantu over the pure black element.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Ova Herero</div>

<div class="sidenote">Cattle and Hill
Damaras.</div>

<p>West of Bechuanaland the continuity of the Bantu domain
is arrested in the south by the Hottentots, who still hold their
ground in Namaqualand, and farther north by the
few wandering Bushman groups of the Kalahari
desert.  Even in Damaraland, which is mainly
Bantu territory, there are interminglings of long standing that
have given rise to much ethnical confusion. The Ova-Herero,
who were here dominant, and the kindred Ova-Mpo of
Ovampoland bordering on the Portuguese possessions, are
undoubted Bantus of somewhat fine physique,
though intellectually not specially distinguished.
Owing to the character of the country, a somewhat
arid, level steppe between the hills and the coast, they
are often collectively called "Cattle Damaras," or "Damaras
of the Plains," in contradistinction to the "Hill Damaras" of
the coast ranges. To this popular nomenclature is due the
prevalent confusion regarding these aborigines. The term<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
"Damara" is of Hottentot origin, and is not recognised by
the local tribes, who all call themselves Ova-Herero, that is,
"Merry People." But there is a marked difference between
the lowlanders and the highlanders, the latter, that is, the
"Hill Damaras," having a strong strain of Hottentot blood,
and being now of Hottentot speech.</p>

<p>The whole region is a land of transition between the two
races, where the struggle for supremacy was scarcely arrested
by the temporary intervention of German administrators.
Though annexed by Germany in 1884, fighting continued for
ten years longer, and, breaking out again in 1903, was not
subdued until 1908, after the loss to Germany of 5000 lives
and &pound;15,000,000, while 20,000 to 30,000 of the Herero are
estimated to have perished. Under the rule of the Union of
South Africa this maltreatment of the natives will never occur
again. Clearness would be gained by substituting for Hill
Damaras the expression <i>Ova-Zorotu</i>, or "Hillmen," as they
are called by their neighbours of the plains, who should of
course be called Hereros to the absolute exclusion of the
expression "Cattle Damaras." These Hereros show a
singular dislike for salt; the peculiarity, however, can scarcely
be racial, as it is shared in also by their cattle, and may be due
to the heavy vapours, perhaps slightly charged with saline
particles, which hang so frequently over the coastlands.</p>

<p>No very sharp ethnical line can be drawn between
Portuguese West Africa and the contiguous portion of the
Belgian Congo south and west of the main stream. In the
coastlands between the Cunene and the Congo estuary a few
groups, such as the historical <i>Eshi-Kongo</i><a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> and the <i>Kabindas</i>,
have developed some marked characteristics under European
influences, just as have the cannibal <i>Ma-Nyema</i> of the Upper
Congo through association with the Nubian-Arab slave-raiders.
But with the exception of the <i>Ba-Shilange</i>, the
<i>Ba-Lolo</i> and one or two others, much the same physical and
mental traits are everywhere presented by the numerous
Bantu populations within the great bend of the Congo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Old Kongo
Empire.</div>

<p>The people who give their name to this river present
some points of special interest. It is commonly supposed that
the old "Kongo Empire" was a creation of
the Portuguese. But Mbanza, afterwards rechristened
"San Salvador," was already the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
capital of a powerful state when it was first visited by the
expedition of 1491, from which time date its relations with
Portugal. At first the Catholic missionaries had great success,
thousands were at least baptised, and for a moment it seemed
as if all the Congo lands were being swept into the fold.
There were great rejoicings on the conversion of the <i>Mfumu</i>
("Emperor") himself, on whom were lavished honours and
Portuguese titles still borne by his present degenerate
descendant, the Portuguese state pensioner, "Dom Pedro V,
Catholic King of Kongo and its Dependencies." But
Christianity never struck very deep roots, and, except in the
vicinity of the Imperial and vassal Courts, heathenish practices
of the worst description were continued down to the middle of
the nineteenth century. About 1870 fresh efforts were made
both by Protestant and Catholic missionaries to re-convert
the people, who had little to remind them of their former faith
except the ruins of the cathedral of San Salvador, crucifixes,
banners, and other religious emblems handed down as heirlooms
and regarded as potent fetishes by their owners. A like
fate, it may be incidentally mentioned, has overtaken the
efforts of the Portuguese missionaries to evangelise the natives
of the east coast, where little now survives of their teachings
but snatches of unintelligible songs to the Blessed Virgin, such
as that still chanted by the Lower Zambesi boatmen and
recorded by Mrs Pringle:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Kongo
Aborigines.</div>

<p>It is probable that at some remote period the ruling race
reached the west coast from the north-east, and imposed their
Bantu speech on the rude aborigines, by whom
it is still spoken over a wide tract of country on
both sides of the Lower Congo.  It is an
extremely pure and somewhat archaic member of the Bantu
family, and W. Holman Bentley, our best authority on the
subject, is enthusiastic in praise of its "richness, flexibility,
exactness, subtlety of idea, and nicety of expression," a
language superior to the people themselves, "illiterate folk
with an elaborate and regular grammatical system of speech of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>such subtlety and exactness of idea that its daily use is in
itself an education<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>." Kishi-Kongo has the distinction of
being the first Bantu tongue ever reduced to written form,
the oldest known work in the language being a treatise on
Christian Doctrine published in Lisbon in 1624. Since that
time the speech of the "Mociconghi," as Pigafetta calls them<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>,
has undergone but slight phonetic or other change, which is
all the more surprising when we consider the
rudeness of the present Mushi-Kongos and
others by whom it is still spoken with considerable
uniformity. Some of these believe themselves
sprung from trees, as if they had still reminiscences of the
arboreal habits of a pithecoid ancestry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Perverted

<p>Amongst the neighbouring <i>Ba-Mba</i>, whose sobas were
formerly <i>ex officio</i> Commanders-in-chief of the Empire, still
dwells a potent being, who is invisible to everybody, and
although mortal never dies, or at least after each dissolution
springs again into life from his remains gathered up by the
priests. All the young men of the tribe undergo
a similar transformation, being thrown into a
death-like trance by the magic arts of the
medicine-man, and then resuscitated after three days. The
power of causing the cataleptic sleep is said really to exist,
and these strange rites, unknown elsewhere, are probably to
be connected with the resurrection of Christ after three days
and of everybody on the last day as preached by the early
Portuguese evangelists. A volume might be written on the
strange distortions of Christian doctrines amongst savage
peoples unable to grasp their true inwardness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Kabindas
and "Black
Jews."</div>

<p>In Angola the Portuguese distinguish between the <i>Pretos</i>,
that is, the "civilised," and the <i>Negros</i>, or unreclaimed natives.
Yet both terms mean the same thing, as
also does <i>Ba-Fiot</i><a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>, "Black People," which is
applied in an arbitrary way both to the Eshi-Kongos
and their near relations, the <i>Kabindas</i> of the Portuguese<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
enclave north of the Lower Congo. These Kabindas, so
named from the seaport of that name on the Loango coast,
are an extremely intelligent, energetic, and enterprising people,
daring seafarers, and active traders. But they complain of
the keen rivalry of another dark people, the <i>Judeos Pretos</i>, or
"Black Jews," who call themselves <i>Ma-Vambu</i>, and whose
hooked nose combined with other peculiarities has earned for
them their Portuguese name. The Kabindas say that these
"Semitic Negroes" were specially created for the punishment
of other unscrupulous dealers by their ruinous competition
in trade.</p>

<p>A great part of the vast region within the bend of the
Congo is occupied by the <i>Ba-Luba</i> people, whose numerous
branches&mdash;<i>Ba-Sange</i> and <i>Ba-Songe</i> about the sources of the
Sankuru, <i>Ba-Shilange</i> (<i>Tushilange</i>) about the Lulua-Kassai
confluence, and many others&mdash;extend all the way from the
Kwango basin to Manyemaland. Most of these are Bantus
of the average type, fairly intelligent, industrious and specially
noted for their skill in iron and copper work. Iron ores are
widely diffused and the copper comes from the famous
mines of the Katanga district, of which King Mzidi and his
Wa-Nyamwezi followers were dispossessed by the Congo
Free State in 1892<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Tushilange
Bhang-Smokers.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Bantu

<p>Special attention is claimed by the <i>Ba-Shilange</i> nation,
for our knowledge of whom we are indebted chiefly to
C. S. Latrobe Bateman<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>. These are the people
whom Wissmann had already referred to as "a
nation of thinkers with the interrogative 'why'
constantly on their lips." Bateman also describes them as
"thoroughly honest, brave to foolhardiness, and faithful to
each other. They are prejudiced in favour of foreign customs
and spontaneously copy the usages of civilisation. They are
the only African tribe among whom I have observed anything
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>like a becoming conjugal affection and regard. To say nothing
of such recommendations as their emancipation from fetishism,
their ancient abandonment of cannibalism, and their national
unity under the sway of a really princely prince (Kalemba),
I believe them to be the most open to the best influences of
civilisation of any African tribe whatsoever<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>." Their territory
about the Lulua, affluent of the Kassai, is the so-called Lubuka,
or land of "Friendship," the theatre of a remarkable social
revolution, carried out independently of all European influences,
in fact before the arrival of any whites on the scene. It was
initiated by the secret brotherhood of the <i>Bena-Riamba</i>, or
"Sons of Hemp," established about 1870, when the nation
became divided into two parties over the question
throwing the country open to foreign trade.
The king having sided with the "Progressives,"
the "Conservatives" were worsted with much bloodshed,
whereupon the barriers of seclusion were swept away. Trading
relations being at once established with the outer world, the
custom of <i>riamba</i> (bhang) smoking was unfortunately introduced
through the Swahili traders from Zanzibar. The
practice itself soon became associated with mystic rites, and
was followed by a general deterioration of morals throughout
Tushilangeland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Ba-Lolo
"Men of iron."</div>

<p>North of the Ba-Luba follows the great <i>Ba-Lolo</i> nation,
whose domain comprises nearly the whole of the region between
the equator and the left bank of the Congo, and
whose Kilolo speech is still more widely diffused,
being spoken by perhaps 10,000,000 within the
horseshoe bend. These "Men of Iron" in the sense of
Cromwell's "Ironsides," or "Workers in Iron," as the name
has been diversely interpreted (from <i>lolo</i>, iron), may not be
all that they have been depicted by the glowing pen of
Mrs H. Grattan Guinness<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>; but nobody will deny their claim
to be regarded as physically, if not mentally, one of the finest
Bantu races. But for the strain of Negro blood betrayed by
the tumid under lip, frizzly hair, and wide nostrils, many might
pass for average Hamites with high forehead, straight or
aquiline nose, bright eye, and intelligent expression. They
appear to have migrated about a hundred years ago from the
east to their present homes, where they have cleared the land<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
both of its forests and the aborigines, brought extensive tracts
under cultivation, and laid out towns in the American chessboard
fashion, but with the houses so wide apart that it takes
hours to traverse them. They are skilled in many crafts,
and understand the division-of-labour principle, "farmers,
gardeners, smiths, boatbuilders, weavers, cabinet-makers,
armourers, warriors, and speakers being already differentiated
amongst them<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The West
Equatorial
Bantus.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Ba-Kalai.</div>

<p>From the east or north-east a great stream of migration
has also for many years been setting right across the cannibal
zone to the west coast between the Ogowai and
Camer&uacute;ns estuary.  Some of these cannibal
bands, collectively known as <i>Fans</i>, <i>Pahuins</i>,
<i>Mpangwes</i><a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>, <i>Oshyebas</i> and by other names, have already
swarmed into the Gab&uacute;n and Lower Ogowai districts, where
they have caused a considerable dislocation of the coast tribes.
They are at present the dominant, or at least the most powerful
and dreaded, people in West Equatorial Africa, where nothing
but the intervention of the French administration has prevented
them from sweeping the <i>Mpongwes</i>, <i>Mbengas</i>,
<i>Okandas</i>, <i>Ashangos</i>, <i>Ishogos</i>, <i>Ba-Tekes</i><a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>, and the other maritime
populations into the Atlantic. Even the great <i>Ba-Kalai</i>
nation, who are also immigrants, but from the
south-east, and who arrived some time before the
Fans, have been hard pressed and driven forward by those
fierce anthropophagists. They are still numerous, certainly
over 100,000, but confined mainly to the left bank of the
Ogowai, where their copper and iron workers have given up
the hopeless struggle to compete with the imported European
wares, and have consequently turned to trade. The Ba-Kalai
are now the chief brokers and middlemen throughout the
equatorial coastlands, and their pure Bantu language is
encroaching on the Mpongwe in the Ogowai basin.</p>

Fans.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Migrations,
Type, Origin.</div>

<p>When first heard of by Bowdich in 1819, the Pa&auml;mways,
as he calls the Fans, were an inland people presenting such
marked Hamitic or Caucasic features that he allied them
with the West Sudanese Fulahs. Since then there have
been inevitable interminglings, by which the
type has no doubt been modified, though still
presenting distinct non-Bantu or non-Negro
characters. Burton, Winwood Reade, Oscar Lenz and most
other observers separate them altogether from the Negro
connection, describing them as "well-built, tall
and slim, with a light brown complexion, often
inclining to yellow, well-developed beard, and
very prominent frontal bone standing out in a semicircular
protuberance above the superciliary arches. Morally also,
they differ greatly from the Negro, being remarkably intelligent,
truthful, and of a serious temperament, seldom laughing
or indulging in the wild orgies of the blacks<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>."</p>

<p>M. H. Kingsley adds that "the average height in mountain
districts is five feet six to five feet eight (1.67 m. to 1.72 m.), the
difference in stature between men and women not being great.
Their countenances are very bright and expressive, and if once
you have been among them, you can never mistake a Fan.
The Fan is full of fire, temper, intelligence and go; very
teachable, rather difficult to manage, quick to take offence
and utterly indifferent to human life." The cannibalism of
the Fans, though a prevalent habit, is not, according to
Miss Kingsley, due to sacrificial motives. "He does it in his
common sense way. He will eat his next door neighbour's
relations and sell his own deceased to his next door neighbour
in return; but he does not buy slaves and fatten them up for
his table as some of the Middle Congo tribes do.... He has no
slaves, no prisoners of war, no cemeteries, so you must draw
your own conclusions<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>." The Fan language has been grouped
by Sir H. H. Johnston among Bantu tongues, but he describes
it as so corrupt as to be only just recognisable as Bantu. In
linguistic, physical and mental features they thus show a
remarkable divergence from the pure Negro, suggesting
Hamitic probably Fulah elements.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Camer&uacute;n
Bantus.</div>

<p>In the Camer&uacute;n region, which still lies within Bantu
territory, Sir H. H. Johnston<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> divides the numerous local
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>tribes into two groups, the aborigines, such as the <i>Ba-Yong</i>,
<i>Ba-Long</i>, <i>Ba-Sa</i>, <i>Abo</i> and <i>Wuri</i>; and
the later intruders&mdash;<i>Ba-Kundu</i>, <i>Ba-Kwiri</i>,
<i>Dwala</i>, "<i>Great Batanga</i>" and <i>Ibea</i>&mdash;chiefly
from the east and south-east.  Best known are the Dwalas
of the Camer&uacute;n estuary, physically typical Bantus with almost
European features, and well-developed calves, a character
which would alone suffice to separate them from the true
Negro. Nor are these traits due to contact with the white
settlers on the coast, because the Dwalas keep quite aloof,
and are so proud of their "blue blood," that till lately all half-breeds
were "weeded-out," being regarded as monsters who
reflected discredit on the tribe<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bantu-Sudanese

<p>Socially the Camer&uacute;n natives stand at nearly the same low
level of culture as the neighbouring full-blood Negroes of the
Calabar and Niger delta.  Indeed the transition
in customs and institutions, as well as in physical
appearance, is scarcely perceptible between the
peoples dwelling north and south of the Rio del Rey, here
the dividing line between the Negro and Bantu lands. The
<i>Ba-Kish</i> of the Meme river, almost last of the Bantus, differ
little except in speech from the Negro <i>Efiks</i> of Old Calabar,
while witchcraft and other gross superstitions were till lately
as rife amongst the Ba-Kwiri and Ba-Kundu tribes of the
western Camer&uacute;n as anywhere in Negroland. It is not long
since one of the Ba-Kwiri, found guilty of having eaten a
chicken at a missionary's table, was himself eaten by his
fellow clansmen. The law of blood for blood was pitilessly
enforced, and charges of witchcraft were so frequent that
whole villages were depopulated, or abandoned by their
terror-stricken inhabitants. The island of Ambas in the inlet
of like name remained thus for a time absolutely deserted,
"most of the inhabitants having poisoned each other off with
their everlasting ordeals, and the few survivors ending by
dreading the very air they breathed<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early Bantu

<p>Having thus completed our survey of the Bantu populations
from the central dividing line about the Congo-Chad
water-parting round by the east, south, and west coastlands,
and so back to the Sudanese zone, we may pause to ask,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>What routes were followed by the Bantus themselves during
the long ages required to spread themselves
over an area estimated at nearly six million
square miles? I have established, apparently
on solid grounds, a fixed point of initial dispersion
in the extreme north-east, and allusion has frequently
been made to migratory movements, some even now going
on, generally from east to west, and, on the east side of the
continent, from north to south, with here an important but
still quite recent reflux from Zululand back nearly to Victoria
Nyanza. If a parallel current be postulated as setting on
the Atlantic side in prehistoric times from south to north,
from Hereroland to the Camer&uacute;ns, or possibly the other
way, we shall have nearly all the factors needed to explain
the general dispersion of the Bantu peoples over their vast
domain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eastern
Ancestry and

Worshippers.</div>

<p>Support is given to this view by the curious distribution
of the two chief Bantu names of the "Supreme Being," to
which incidental reference has already been made. As first
pointed out I think by Dr Bleek, <i>(M)unkulunkulu</i>
with its numerous variants prevails along
the eastern seaboard, <i>Nzambi</i> along the western,
and both in many parts of the interior; while
here and there the two meet, as if to indicate prehistoric
interminglings of two great primeval migratory movements.
From the subjoined table a clear idea may be had of the
general distribution:</p>

<p>Of <i>Munkulunkulu</i> the primitive idea is clear enough from
its best preserved form, the Zulu <i>Unkulunkulu</i>, which is a
repetitive of the root <i>inkulu</i>, great, old, hence a deification of
the great departed, a direct outcome of the ancestry-worship
so universal amongst Negro and Bantu peoples<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>. Thus Unkulunkulu
becomes the direct progenitor of the Zulu-Xosas:
<i>Unkulunkulu ukobu wetu</i>. But the fundamental meaning of
<i>Nzambi</i> is unknown. The root does not occur in Kishi-Kongo,
and Bentley rightly rejects Kolbe's far-fetched
explanation from the Herero, adding that "the knowledge of
God is most vague, scarcely more than nominal. There is no
worship paid to God<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>."</p>

<p>More probable seems W. H. Tooke's suggestion that
Nzambi is "a Nature spirit like Zeus or Indra," and that,
while the eastern Bantus are ancestor-worshippers, "the
western adherents of Nzambi are more or less Nature-worshippers.
In this respect they appear to approach the
Negroes of the Gold, Slave, and Oil Coasts<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>." No doubt
the cult of the dead prevails also in this region, but here it is
combined with naturalistic forms of belief, as on the Gold
Coast, where <i>Bobowissi</i>, chief god of all the southern tribes,
is the "Blower of Clouds," the "Rain-maker," and on the
Slave Coast, where the Dahoman <i>Mawu</i> and the Yoruba
<i>Olorun</i> are the Sky or Rain, and the "Owner of the Sky"
(the deified Firmament), respectively<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conclusion.</div>

<p>It would therefore seem probable that the Munkulunkulu
peoples from the north-east gradually spread by the indicated
routes over the whole of Bantuland, everywhere imposing
their speech, general culture, and ancestor-worship on the
pre-Bantu aborigines, except along the Atlantic coastlands
and in parts of the interior. Here the primitive Nature-worship,
embodied in Nzambi, held and still holds its ground,
both meeting on equal terms&mdash;as shown in the above table&mdash;amongst
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>the Ba-Yanzi, the Ova-Herero, and the Be-Chuanas
(<i>Mulungulu</i> generally, but <i>Nyampe</i> in Barotseland), and no
doubt in other inland regions. But the absolute supremacy
of one on the east, and of the other on the west,
side of the continent, seems conclusive as to the
general streams of migration, while the amazing uniformity
of nomenclature is but another illustration of the almost
incredible persistence of Bantu speech amongst these multitudinous
illiterate populations for an incalculable period of
time<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Vaalpens and the Strandloopers.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The Kattea or
Vaalpens.</div>

<p>Among the ethnological problems of Africa may be
reckoned the <i>Vaalpens</i> and the <i>Strandloopers</i>. Along the
banks of the Limpopo between the Transvaal
and Southern Rhodesia there are scattered a
few small groups of an extremely primitive
people who are generally confounded with the Bushmen, but
differ in some important respects from that race. They are
the "Earthmen" of some writers, but their real name is
<i>Kattea</i>, though called by their neighbours either <i>Ma Sarwa</i>
("Bad People") or <i>Vaalpens</i> ("Grey Paunches") from the
khaki colour acquired by their bodies from creeping on all
fours into their underground hovels. But the true colour is
almost a pitch black, and as they are only about four feet high
they are quite distinct both from the tall Bantus and the
yellowish Hottentot-Bushmen. For the Zulus they are mere
"dogs" or "vultures," and are certainly the most degraded
of all the aborigines, being undoubtedly cannibals, eating their
own aged and infirm like some of the Amazonian tribes.
Their habitations are holes in the ground, rock-shelters, or
caves, or lately a few hovels of mud and foliage at the foot
of the hills. Of their speech nothing is known except that
it is absolutely distinct both from the Bantu and the Bushman.
There are no arts or industries of any kind, not even any
weapons beyond those procured in exchange for ostrich
feathers, skins or ivory. But they can make fire, and are
thus able to cook the offal thrown to them by the Boers in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
return for their help in skinning the captured game. Whether
they have any religious ideas it is impossible to say, all intercourse
with the surrounding peoples being restricted to barter
carried on with gesture language for nobody has ever yet
mastered their tongue. A "chief" is spoken of, but he is
merely a headman who presides over the little family groups
of from thirty to fifty (there are no tribes properly so called),
and whose purely domestic functions are acquired, not by
heredity, but by personal worth, that is, physical strength.
Altogether the Kattea is perhaps the most perfect embodiment
of the pure savage still anywhere surviving<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Strandloopers.</div>

<p>When the Hottentots of South Africa were questioned
by scientific men a hundred years ago and more regarding
their traditions, they were wont to refer to their
predecessors on the coast of South Africa as a
savage race living on the seashore and subsisting
on shellfish and the bodies of stranded whales. From their
habits these were styled in Dutch the Strandloopers or "Shore-runners<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>."
According to F. C. Shrubsall the Strandlooper of
the Cape Colony caves preceded the Bushman in South
Africa. They were a race of short but not dwarfish men
with a much higher skull capacity than that of the average
Bush race. The extreme of cranial capacity in the Strandloopers
was a maximum of over 1600 c.c., while the extreme
minimum among the Bush people descends as low as 955 c.c.
The frontal region of the skull is much better developed than
in the Bush race, and in that respect is more like the Negro.
There is little or no brow prominence and one at least of the
skulls is as orthognathous in facial angle as that of a European.
L. Peringuey remarks also that the type was less dolichocephalic
than the Bushmen and Hottentots, under 80 in
cephalic index. "He was artistically gifted, like the race
which occupied and decorated the Altamira ... and other caves
of Spain and France. He painted; he possibly carved on
rocks; he used bone tools; he made pottery; he perforated
stones for either heading clubs or to be used as make-weights
for digging tools; his ornaments consisted of sea-shells; and
the ostrich egg-shell discs which he made may be said to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
a typical product of his industry. And this culture is retained
in South Africa by a kindred race, but more dolichocephalic&mdash;the
Bushmen-Hottentots. Analogous are most of his tools
and his expressions of culture to those of Aurignacian
man."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Negrilloes.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Negrilloes at
the Courts of
the Pharaohs.</div>

<p>The proper domain of the African Negrilloes is the intertropical
forest-land, although they appear to be at present
confined to somewhat narrow limits, between
about six degrees of latitude north and south of
the equator, unless the Bushmen be included. But formerly
they probably ranged much farther north, and in historic
times were certainly known in Egypt some 4000 or 5000 years
ago. This is evident from the frequent references to them
in the "Book of the Dead" as far back as the 6th Dynasty.
Like the dwarfs in medieval times, they were in high request
at the courts of the Pharaohs, who sent expeditions
to fetch these <i>Danga</i> (<i>Tank</i>) from the
"Island of the Double," that is, the fabulous
region of Shade Land beyond Punt, where they dwelt. The
first of whom there is authentic record was brought from this
region, apparently the White Nile, to King Assa (3300 <small>B.C.</small>)
by his officer, Baurtet. Some 70 years later Heru-Khuf,
another officer, was sent by Pepi II "to bring back a pygmy
alive and in good health," from the land of great trees away
to the south<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>. That the Danga came from the south we know
from a later inscription at Karnak, and that the word meant
dwarf is clear from the accompanying determinative of a
short person of stunted growth.</p>

<p>It is curious to note in this connection that the limestone
statue of the dwarf Nem-hotep, found in his tomb at Sakkara
and figured by Ernest Grosse, has a thick elongated head
suggesting artificial deformation, unshapely mouth, dull expression,
strong full chest, and small deformed feet, on which
he seems badly balanced. It will be remembered that
Schweinfurth's Akkas from Mangbattuland were also represented
as top-heavy, although the best observers, Junker and
others, describe those of the Welle and Congo forests as
shapely and by no means ill-proportioned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Negrilloes
and Pygmy
Folklore.</div>

<p>Kollmann also, who has examined the remains of the
Neolithic pygmies from the Schweizersbild Station, Switzerland,
"is quite certain that the dwarf-like proportions
of the latter have nothing in common
with diseased conditions. This, from many
points of view, is a highly interesting discovery.  It is
possible, as N&uuml;esch suggests, that the widely-spread legend
as to the former existence of little men, dwarfs and gnomes,
who were supposed to haunt caves and retired places in the
mountains, may be a reminiscence of these Neolithic pygmies<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Dume and
Doko, reputed
Dwarfs.</div>

<p>This is what may be called the picturesque aspect of the
Negrillo question, which it seems almost a pity to spoil by
too severe a criticism.  But "ethnologic truth" obliges us to
say that the identification of the African Negrillo with
Kollmann's European dwarfs still lacks scientific proof.
Even craniology fails us here, and although the Negrilloes
are in great majority round-headed, R. Verneau has shown
that there may be exceptions<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>, while the theory of the general
uniformity of the physical type has broken down at some
other points. Thus the <i>Dume</i>, south of Gallaland,
discovered by Donaldson Smith<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> in the
district where the <i>Doko</i> Negrilloes had long been
heard of, and even seen by Antoine d'Abbadie in 1843, were
found to average five feet, or more than one foot over the
mean of the true Negrillo.  D'Abbadie in fact declared that
his "Dokos" were not pygmies at all<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>, while Donaldson
Smith now tells us that "doko" is only a term of contempt
applied by the local tribes to their "poor relations." "Their
chief characteristics were a black skin, round features, woolly
hair, small oval-shaped eyes, rather thick lips, high cheekbones,
a broad forehead, and very well formed bodies"
(p. 273).</p>

<p>The expression of the eye was canine, "sometimes timid
and suspicious-looking, sometimes very amiable and merry,
and then again changing suddenly to a look of intense anger."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Pygmies, he adds, "inhabited the whole of the country north
of Lakes Stephanie and Rudolf long before any of the tribes
now to be found in the neighbourhood; but they have been
gradually killed off in war, and have lost their characteristics
by inter-marriage with people of large stature, so that only
this one little remnant, the Dume, remains to prove the
existence of a pygmy race. Formerly they lived principally
by hunting, and they still kill a great many elephants with
their poisoned arrows" (pp. 274-5).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Wandorobbo
Hunters.</div>

<p>Some of these remarks apply also to the <i>Wandorobbo</i>,
another small people who range nearly as far north as the
Dume, but are found chiefly farther south all
over Masailand, and belong, I have little doubt,
to the same connection. They are the henchmen
of the Masai, whom they provide with big game in
return for divers services.</p>

<p>Those met by W. Astor Chanler were also "armed with
bows and arrows, and each carried an elephant-spear, which
they called <i>bonati</i>. This spear is six feet in length, thick at
either end, and narrowed where grasped by the hand. In
one end is bored a hole, into which is fitted an arrow two feet
long, as thick as one's thumb, and with a head two inches
broad. Their method of killing elephants is to creep
cautiously up to the beast, and drive a spear into its loin.
A quick twist separates the spear from the arrow, and they
make off as fast and silently as possible. In all cases the
arrows are poisoned; and if they are well introduced into the
animal's body, the elephant does not go far<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Wochua
Mimics.</div>

<p>From some of the peculiarities of the Achua (Wochua)
Negrilloes met by Junker south of the Welle one can understand
why these little people were such favourites
with the old Egyptian kings. These were
"distinguished by sharp powers of observation,
amazing talent for mimicry, and a good memory. A striking
proof of this was afforded by an Achua whom I had seen and
measured four years previously in Rumbek, and now again
met at Gambari's. His comic ways and quick nimble movements
made this little fellow the clown of our society. He
imitated with marvellous fidelity the peculiarities of persons
whom he had once seen; for instance, the gestures and facial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
expressions of Jussuf Pasha esh-Shelahis and of Haj Halil
at their devotions, as well as the address and movements of
Emin Pasha, 'with the four eyes' (spectacles). His imitation
of Hawash Effendi in a towering rage, storming and abusing
everybody, was a great success; and now he took me off to
the life, rehearsing after four years, down to the minutest
details, and with surprising accuracy, my anthropometric performance
when measuring his body at Rumbek<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>."</p>

<p>A somewhat similar account is given by Ludwig Wolf of
the Ba-Twa pygmies visited by him and Wissmann in the
Kassai region. Here are whole villages in the forest-glades
inhabited by little people with an average height of about
4 feet 3 inches. They are nomads, occupied exclusively with
hunting and the preparation of palm-wine, and are regarded
by their Ba-Kubu neighbours as benevolent little people,
whose special mission is to provide the surrounding tribes
with game and palm-wine in exchange for manioc, maize, and
bananas<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>.</p>

<p>Despite the above-mentioned deviations, occurring chiefly
about the borderlands, considerable uniformity both of physical
and mental characters is found to prevail amongst the typical
Negrillo groups scattered in small hunting communities all
over the Welle, Semliki, Congo, and Ogowai woodlands.
Their main characters are thus described. Their skin is of
a reddish or yellowish brown in colour, sometimes very dark.
Their height varies from 1.37 m. to 1.45 m. (4 ft. 4&frac14; in. to
4 ft. 9&frac14; in.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>). Their hair is very short and woolly, usually of
a dark rusty brown colour; the face hair is variable, but the
body is usually covered with a light downy hair. The cephalic
index is 79. The nose is very broad and exceptionally
flattened at the root; the lips are usually thin, and the upper
one long; the eyes are protuberant; the face is sometimes
prognathic. Steatopygia occurs. They are a markedly intelligent
people, innately musical, cunning, revengeful and
suspicious in disposition, but they never steal.</p>

<p>They are nomadic hunters and collectors, never resorting
to agriculture. They have no domestic animals. Only meat
is cooked. They wear no clothing. They use bows and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
poisoned arrows. Their language is unknown. They live
in small communities which centre round a cunning fighter
or able hunter. Their dead are buried in the ground. They
differ from surrounding Negroes in having no veneration for
the departed, no amulets, no magicians or professional priests.
They have charms for ensuring luck in hunting, but it is
uncertain whether these charms derive their potency from the
supreme being, though evidence of belief in a high-god is
reported from various pygmy peoples.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Bushmen and Hottentots</span>.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Bushmen
and Hottentots.
Former and
Present Range.</div>

<p>Towards the south the Negrillo domain was formerly
conterminous with that of the Bushmen, of whom traces were
discovered by Sir H. H. Johnston<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> as far north
as Lakes Nyasa and Tanganyika, and who, it
has been conjectured, belong to the same primitive
stock. The differences mental and physical
now separating the two sections of the family may perhaps
be explained by the different environments&mdash;hot, moist and
densely wooded in the north, and open steppes in the south&mdash;but
until more is known of the African pygmies their affinities
must remain undecided.</p>

<p>The relationship between the Bushmen and the Hottentots
is another disputed question. Early authorities regarded the
Hottentots as the parent family, and the Bushmen as the
offspring, but the researches of Gustav Fritsch, E. T. Hamy,
F. Shrubsall<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> and others show that the Hottentots are a cross
between the Bushmen&mdash;the primitive race&mdash;and the Bantu,
the Bushman element being seen in the leathery colour,
prominent cheek-bones, pointed chin, steatopygia and other
special characters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Wa-Sandawi.</div>

<p>In prehistoric times the Hottentots ranged over a vast
area. Evidence has now been produced of the presence of
a belated Hottentot or Hottentot-Bushman group
as far north as the Kwa-Kokue district, between
Kilimanjaro and Victoria Nyanza. The <i>Wa-Sandawi</i>
people here visited by Oskar Neumann are not Bantus,
and speak a language radically distinct from that of the
neighbouring Bantus, but full of clicks like that of the Bushmen<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>.
Two Sandawi skulls examined by Virchow<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> showed
distinct Hottentot characters, with a cranial capacity of 1250
and 1265 c.c., projecting upper jaw and orthodolicho head<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>.
The geographical prefix <i>Kwa</i>, common in the district (Kwa-Kokue,
Kwa-Mtoro, Kwa-Hindi), is pure Hottentot, meaning
"people," like the postfix <i>qua</i> (<i>Kwa</i>) of Kora-<i>qua</i>, Nama-<i>qua</i>,
etc. in the present Hottentot domain. The transposition of
prefixes and postfixes is a common linguistic phenomenon,
as seen in the Sumero-Akkadian of Babylonia, in the Neo-Sanskritic
tongues of India, and the Latin, Oscan, and other
members of the Old Italic group.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hottentot
Geographical

<p>Farther south a widely-diffused Hottentot-Bushman geographical
terminology attests the former range of this primitive
race all over South Africa, as far north as the
Zambesi. Lichtenstein had already discovered
such traces in the Zulu country<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>, and Vater

Hottentots may be followed in various directions to the very
heart of South Zambesia. Here the memory of their former
presence is perpetuated in the names of such water-courses as
Nos-ob, Up, Mol-opo, Hyg-ap, Gar-ib, in which the syllables
<i>ob</i>, <i>up</i>, <i>ap</i>, <i>ib</i> and others are variants of the Hottentot word
<i>ib</i>, <i>ip</i>, water, river, as in <i>Gar-ib</i>, the "Great River," now
better known as the Orange River. The same indications
may be traced right across the continent to the Atlantic, where
nearly all the coast streams&mdash;even in Hereroland, where the
language has long been extinct&mdash;have the same ending<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hottentots

<p>On the west side the Bushmen are still heard of as far
north as the Cunene, and in the interior beyond Lake Ngami
nearly to the right bank of the Zambesi. But the Hottentots
are now confined mainly to Great and Little Namaqualand.
Elsewhere there appear to be no full-blood natives
of this race, the Koraquas, Gonaquas, Griquas, etc.
being all Hottentot-Boer or Hottentot-Bantu
half-castes of Dutch speech. In Cape Colony the tribal
organisation ceased to exist in 1810, when the last Hottentot
chief was replaced by a European magistrate. Still the
Koraquas keep themselves somewhat distinct about the
Upper Orange and Vaal Rivers, and the Griquas in Griqualand
East, while the Gonaquas, that is, "Borderers," are
being gradually merged in the Bantu populations of the
Eastern Provinces. There are at present scarcely 180,000
south of the Orange River, and of these the great majority
are half-breeds<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bushman

<p>Despite their extremely low state of culture, or, one might

by two remarkable qualities, a fine sense of pictorial
or graphic art<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>, and a rich imagination displayed

vanished for ever, comprise no less than 84 thick volumes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
3600 double-column pages, besides an unfinished Bushman
dictionary with 11,000 entries. There are two great sections,
(1) Myths, fables, legends and poetry, with tales about the sun

Language and
Clicks.</div>

<p>In the tales and myths the sun, moon, and animals speak
either with their own proper clicks, or else use the ordinary
clicks in some way peculiar to themselves.
Thus Bleek tells us that the tortoise changes
clicks in labials, the ichneumon in palatals, the
jackal substitutes linguo-palatals for labials, while
the moon, hare, and ant-eater use "a most unpronounceable
click" of their own.  How many there may be altogether, not
one of which can be properly uttered by Europeans, nobody
seems to know.  But grammarians have enumerated nine,
indicated each by a graphic sign as under:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">

<p>From Bushman&mdash;a language in a state of flux, fragmentary
as the small tribal or rather family groups that speak it<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>&mdash;these
strange inarticulate sounds passed to the number of four
into the remotely related Hottentot, and thence to the number
of three into the wholly unconnected Zulu-Xosa. But they
are heard nowhere else to my knowledge except amongst the
newly-discovered Wa-Sandawi people of South Masailand.
At the same time we know next to nothing of the Negrillo
tongues, and should clicks be discovered to form an element
in their phonetic system also<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>, it would support the assumption
of a common origin of all these dwarfish races now somewhat
discredited on anatomical grounds.</p>

Mental
Characters.</div>

<p>M. G. Bertin, to whom we are indebted for an excellent
monograph on the Bushman<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>, rightly remarks that he is not,
at least mentally, so debased as he has been
described by the early travellers and by the
neighbouring Bantus and Boers, by whom he
has always been despised and harried. "His greatest love
is for freedom, he acknowledges no master, and possesses no
slaves. It is this love of independence which made him prefer
the wandering life of a hunter to that of a peaceful agriculturist
or shepherd, as the Hottentot. He rarely builds a hut, but
prefers for abode the natural caves he finds in the rocks. In
other localities he forms a kind of nest in the bush&mdash;hence his
name of Bushman&mdash;or digs with his nails subterranean caves,
from which he has received the name of 'Earthman.' His
garments consist only of a small skin. His weapons are still
the spear, arrow and bow in their most rudimentary form.
The spear is a mere branch of a tree, to which is tied a piece
of bone or flint; the arrow is only a reed treated in the same
way. The arrow and spear-heads are always poisoned, to
render mortal the slight wounds they inflict. He gathers no
flocks, which would impede his movements, and only accepts
the help of dogs as wild as himself. The Bushmen have,
however, one implement, a rounded stone perforated in the
middle, in which is inserted a piece of wood; with this
instrument, which carries us back to the first age of man, they
dig up a few edible roots growing wild in the desert. To
produce fire, he still retains the primitive system of rubbing
two pieces of wood&mdash;another prehistoric survival."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bushman
Race-names.</div>

<p>Touching their name, it is obvious that these scattered
groups, without hereditary chiefs or social organisation of any
kind, could have no collective designation. The
term <i>Khuai</i>, of uncertain meaning, but probably
to be equated with the Hottentot <i>Khoi</i>, "Men,"
is the name only of a single group, though often applied to the
whole race. <i>Saan</i>, their Hottentot name, is the plural of Sa,
a term also of uncertain origin; <i>Ba-roa</i>, current amongst the
Be-Chuanas, has not been explained, while the Zulu <i>Abatwa</i>
would seem to connect them even by name with Wolf's and
Stanley's <i>Ba-Twa</i> of the Congo forest region. Other so-called
tribal names (there are no "tribes" in the strict sense of the
word) are either nicknames imposed upon them by their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
neighbours, or else terms taken from the localities, as amongst
the Fuegians.</p>

<p>We may conclude with the words of W. J. Sollas: "The
more we know of these wonderful little people the more we
learn to admire and like them. To many solid virtues&mdash;untiring
energy, boundless patience, and fertile invention,
steadfast courage, devoted loyalty, and family affection&mdash;they
added a native refinement of manners and a rare aesthetic
sense. We may learn from them how far the finer excellences
of life may be attained in the hunting stage. In their golden
age, before the coming of civilised man, they enjoyed their life
to the full, glad with the gladness of primeval creatures. The
story of their later days, their extermination and the cruel
manner of it, is a tale of horror on which we do not care to
dwell. They haunt no more the sunlit veldt, their hunting is
over, their nation is destroyed; but they leave behind an
imperishable memory, they have immortalised themselves in
their art<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>."</p>

a Zulu tribe which crossed the Zambesi about 1825, and established themselves
south-east of L. Tanganyika, but later migrated to the uplands west of L. Nyasa,
where they founded three petty states. Others went east of the Livingstone range,
and are here still known as Magwangwara. But all became gradually assimilated
to the surrounding populations. Intermarrying with the women of the country
they preserve their speech, dress, and usages for the first generation in a slightly
modified form, although the language of daily intercourse is that of the mothers.
Then this class becomes the aristocracy of the whole nation, which henceforth
comprises a great part of the aborigines ruled by a privileged caste of Zulu origin,
"perpetuated almost entirely among themselves" ("Central Angoniland," <i>Geograph.
Jour.</i> May, 1898, p. 512). See A. Werner, <i>The Natives of British Central Africa</i>,

<div class="sidenote">General
Ethnical
Relations in
Oceania.</div>

<p>From the data supplied in <i>Ethnology</i>, Chap. XI. a reconstruction
may be attempted of the obscure ethnical relations
in Australasia on the following broad lines.</p>

<p>1. The two main sections of the Ulotrichous
division of mankind, now separated by the intervening
waters of the Indian Ocean, are fundamentally
one.</p>

<p>2. To the Sudanese and Bantu sub-sections in Africa
correspond, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, the Papuan and Melanesian
sub-sections in Oceania, the former being distinguished by
great linguistic diversity, the latter by considerable linguistic
uniformity, and both by a rather wide range of physical
variety within certain well-marked limits.</p>

<p>3. In Africa the physical varieties are due mainly to
Semitic and Hamitic grafts on the Negro stock; in Oceania
mainly to Mongoloid (Malay) and Caucasian (Indonesian)
grafts on the Papuan stock.</p>

<p>4. The Negrillo element in Africa has its counterpart in
an analogous Negrito element in Oceania (Andamanese,
Semangs, Aetas, etc.).</p>

<p>5. In both regions the linguistic diversity apparently
presents similar features&mdash;a large number of languages
differing profoundly in their grammatical structure and
vocabularies, but all belonging to the same agglutinative
order of speech, and also more or less to the same phonetic
system.</p>

<p>6. In both regions the linguistic uniformity is generally
confined to one or two geographical areas, Bantuland in
Africa and Melanesia in Oceania.</p>

<p>7. In Bantuland the linguistic system shows but faint
if any resemblances to any other known tongues, whereas
the Melanesian group is but one branch, though the most
archaic, of the vast Austronesian Family, diffused over the
Indian and Pacific Oceans. The Papuan languages are
entirely distinct from the Melanesian. They are in some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
respects similar to the Australian, but their exact positions
are not yet proved<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The terms
Papuan,
Melanesian
and Papuasian
defined.</div>

<p>8.  Owing to their linguistic, geographical, and to some
extent their physical and social differences, it is desirable to
treat the Papuans and Melanesians as two distinct
though closely related sub-groups, and to
restrict the use of the terms <span class="smcap">Papuan</span> and
<span class="smcap">Melanesian</span> accordingly, while both may be
conveniently comprised under the general or
collective term <span class="smcap">Papuasian</span><a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>.</p>

<p>9.  Here, therefore, by <i>Papuans</i> will be understood the
true aborigines of New Guinea with its eastern Louisiade
dependency<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>, and in the west many of the Malaysian islands
as far as Flores inclusive, where the black element and non-Malay
speech predominate; by <i>Melanesians</i>, the natives of
Melanesia as commonly understood, that is, the Admiralty
Isles, New Britain, New Ireland and Duke of York; the
Solomon Islands; Santa Cruz; the New Hebrides, New
Caledonia, Loyalty, and Fiji, where the black element and
Austronesian speech prevail almost exclusively. <span class="smcap">Papuasia</span>
will thus comprise the insular world from Flores to New
Caledonia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Papuasian

<p>Such appear to be the present limits of the Papuasian

and some writers suggest that it possibly extended

<p>The variation in the inhabitants of New Guinea has often
been recognised and is well described by C. G. Seligman
who remarks<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> that the contrast between the relatively tall,
dark-skinned, frizzly-haired inhabitants of Torres
Straits, the Fly River and the neighbouring
parts of New Guinea on the one hand, and the
smaller lighter coloured peoples to the east,
is so striking that the two peoples must be recognised as
racially distinct. He restricts the name Papuan to the congeries
of frizzly-haired and often mop-headed peoples whose
skin colour is some shade of brownish black, and proposes
the term Papuo-Melanesian for the generally smaller, lighter
coloured, frizzly-haired races of the eastern peninsula and
the islands beyond. Besides these conspicuous differences
"The Papuan is generally taller and is more consistently
dolichocephalic than the Papuo-Melanesian: he
is always darker, his usual colour being a dark
chocolate or sooty brown; his head is high and his face, is,
as a rule, long with prominent brow-ridges, above which his
rather flat forehead commonly slopes backwards. The Papuo-Melanesian
head is usually less high and the brow ridges less
prominent, while the forehead is commonly
rounded and not retreating. The skin colour
runs through the whole gamut of shades of
<i>caf&eacute;-au-lait</i>, from a lightish yellow with only a tinge of
brown, to a tolerably dark bronze colour. The lightest
shades are everywhere uncommon, and in many localities
appear to be limited to the female sex. The Papuan nose is
longer and stouter and is often so arched as to present the
outline known as 'Jewish.' The character of its bridge
varies, typically the nostrils are broad and the tip of the nose
is often hooked downwards. In the Papuo-Melanesian the
nose is generally smaller: both races have frizzly hair, but
while this is universal among Papuans, curly and even wavy
hair is common among both [Eastern and Western] divisions
of Papuo-Melanesians<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Melanesian.</div>

<p>The Melanesians are as variable as the natives of New
Guinea; the hair may be curly, or even wavy, showing
evidence of racial mixture, and the skin is
chocolate or occasionally copper-coloured. The
stature of the men ranges from 1.50 m. to 1.78 m. (4 ft. 11 in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
to 5 ft. 10 in.), with an average between 1.56 m. and 1.6 m.
(5 ft. 1&frac12; in. to 5 ft. 3 in.). The skull is usually dolichocephalic,
but ranges from 67 to 85 and in certain parts
brachycephaly is predominant; the nose shows great diversity.
This type ranges with local variations from the Admiralty
Islands and parts of New Guinea through the Bismarck
Archipelago, Solomon Islands, and the New Hebrides and
other island groups to Fiji and New Caledonia.</p>

due to the assiduous use of the comb; very prominent superciliary
arches and thick eyebrows, whence their somewhat

<div class="sidenote">The Food
Question.</div>

<p>From the state of their industries, in some respects the
rudest, in others amongst the most advanced in Melanesia, it
may be inferred that after their arrival the New Caledonians,
like the Tasmanians, the Andamanese, and some other insular
groups, remained for long ages almost completely secluded
from the rest of the world. Owing to the
poverty of the soil the struggle for food must
always have been severe. Hence the most
jealously guarded privileges of the chiefs were associated with
questions of diet, while the paradise of the dead was a region
where they had abundance of food and could gorge on yams.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General Survey
of Melanesian
Ethnology.</div>

<p>The ethnological history of the whole of the Melanesian
region is obscure, but as the result of recent investigations
certain broad features may be recognised. The
earliest inhabitants were probably a black,
woolly-haired race, now represented by the
pygmies of New Guinea, remnants of a formerly widely extended
Negrito population also surviving in the Andaman
Islands, the Malay Peninsula (Semang) and the Philippines
(Aeta). A taller variety advanced into Tasmania and formed
the Tasmanian group, now extinct, others spread over New
Guinea and the western Pacific as "Papuans," and formed
the basis of the Melanesian populations<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>. The Proto-Polynesians
in their migrations from the East Indian Archipelago
to Polynesia passed through this region and imposed their
speech on the population and otherwise modified it. In
later times other migrations have come from the west, and
parts of Melanesia have also been directly influenced by
movements from Polynesia. The result of these supposed
influences has been to form the Melanesian peoples as they
exist to-day<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>.  G. Friederici<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> has accumulated a vast amount<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
of evidence based chiefly on linguistics and material culture,
to support the theory of Melanesian cultural streams from
the west. He regards the Melanesians as having come from
that part of Indonesia which extends from the Southern
Islands of the Philippine group, through the Minahasa
peninsula of Celebes, to the Moluccas in the neighbourhood
of Buru and Ceram. From the Moluccan region they passed
north of New Guinea to the region about Vitiaz and Dampier
Straits, which Friederici regards as the gateway of Melanesia.
Here they colonised the northern shores of New Britain,
and part of the swarm settled along the eastern and south-eastern
shores of New Guinea. Another stream passed to
the Northern Louisiades, Southern Solomons, and Northern
New Hebrides. The Philippine or sub-Philippine stream
took a more northerly route, going by the Admiralty group to
New Hanover, East New Ireland and the Solomons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cultural
Problems.</div>

<p>The first serious attempt to disentangle the complex character
of Melanesian ethnography was made by F. Graebner
in 1905<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>, followed by G. Friederici, the references
to whose work are given above. More recently
W. H. R. Rivers<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> has attacked the cultural
problem by means of the genealogical method and the results
of his investigations are here briefly summarised. He has
discovered several remarkable forms of marriage in Melanesia
and has deduced others which have existed previously. He
argues that the anomalous forms of marriage imply a former
dual organisation (<i>i.e.</i> a division of the community into two
exogamous groups) with matrilineal descent, and he is driven
to assume that in early times there was a state of society in
which the elders had acquired so predominant a position that
they were able to monopolise all the young women. Some
of the relationship systems are of great antiquity, and it is
evident that changes have taken place due to cultural influences
coming in from without.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kava-drinking
and
Betel-chewing.</div>

<p>The distribution of kava-drinking and betel-chewing is of
great interest. The former occurs all over Polynesia
(except Easter Island and New Zealand)
and throughout southern Melanesia, including<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
certain Santa Cruz Islands, where it is limited to religious
ceremonial. Betel-chewing begins at these islands and extends
northwards through New Guinea and Indonesia to India.
Kava and betel were introduced into Melanesia by different
cultural migrations.</p>

<p>The introduction of betel-chewing was relatively late and
restricted and may have taken place from Indonesia after the
invasion by the Hindus. With it were associated strongly
established patrilineal institutions, marriage with a wife of
a father's brother, the special sanctity of the skull and the
plank-built canoe. The use of pile dwellings is a more
constant element of the betel-culture than of the kava-culture.
The religious ritual centres round the skulls of
ancestors and relatives, and the cult of the skull has taken
a direction which gives the heads of enemies an importance
equal to that of relatives, hence head-hunting has become the
chief object of warfare. The skull of a relative is the symbol&mdash;if
not the actual abiding place&mdash;of the dead, to be honoured
and propitiated, while the skulls of enemies act as the means
whereby this honour and propitiation are effected.</p>

<p>The influence of the kava-using peoples was more extensive
in time and space than that of the betel-chewing people.
Rivers supposes that they had neither clan organisation nor
exogamy. Some of them preserved the body after death and
respect was paid to the head or skull. It is possible that the
custom of payment for a wife came into existence in Melanesia
as the result of the need of the immigrant men for women of
the indigenous people owing to their bringing few women with
them, and the great development of shell money may be due
in part to those payments. Contact with the earlier populations
also resulted in the development of secret societies.
The immigrants introduced the cult of the dead and the
institutions of taboo, totemism and chieftainship. They
brought with them the form of outrigger canoe and the
knowledge of plank-building for canoes (which however was
only partially adopted), the rectangular house, and may have
known the art of making pile dwellings. They introduced
various forms of currency made of shells, teeth, feathers, mats,
etc., the drill, the slit drum, or gong, the conch trumpet, the
fowl, pig, dog, and megalithic monuments.</p>

<p>There may have been two immigrations of peoples who
made monuments of stone: 1. Those who erected the more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
dolmen-like structures, probably had aquatic totems, and
interred their dead in the extended position.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stone
Monuments.</div>

<p>2. A later movement of people whose stone
structures tended to take the form of pyramids,
who had bird totems, practised a cult of the sun and
cremated their dead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Dual-people.</div>

<p>When the kava-using people came into Melanesia they
found it already inhabited. The earliest form of social organisation
of which we have evidence was on the
dual basis, associated with matrilineal descent,
the dominance of the old men (gerontocracy) and
certain peculiar forms of marriage. These people interred
their dead in the contracted or sitting position, which also was
employed in most parts of Polynesia. Evidently they feared
the ghosts and removed their dead as completely as possible
from the living. These people&mdash;whom we may speak of as the
"dual-people"&mdash;were communistic in property and probably
practised sexual communism; the change towards the institution
of individual property and individual marriage were
assisted by, if not entirely due to, the influence of the kava-people.
They practised circumcision. Magic was an indigenous
institution. Characteristic is the cult of <i>vui</i>, unnamed
local spirits with definite haunts or abiding places whose
rites are performed in definite localities. In the Northern
New Hebrides the offerings connected with <i>vui</i> are not
made to the <i>vui</i> themselves but to the man who owns the
place connected with the <i>vui</i>. It would seem as if ownership
of a locality carried with it ownership of the <i>vui</i> connected
with the locality. Thus <i>vui</i> are local spirits belonging to the
indigenous owners of the soil, and there seems no reason to
believe that they were ever ghosts of dead men. As totemism
occurs among the dual-people of the Bismarck Archipelago
(who live in parts of New Britain and New Ireland and
Duke of York Island) it is possible that the kava-people were
not the sole introducers of totemism into Melanesia. The
dual-people were probably acquainted with the bow, which
they may have called <i>busur</i>, and the dug-out canoe which
was used either lashed together in pairs or singly with an
outrigger.</p>

<p>The origin of a dual organisation is generally believed to
be due to fission, but it is more reasonable to regard it as due
to fusion, as hostility is so frequently manifest between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
two groups despite the fact that spouses are always obtained
from the other moiety. In New Ireland (and elsewhere)
each moiety is associated with a hero; one acts wisely but
unscrupulously, the other is a fool who is always falling an
easy victim to the first. Each moiety has a totem bird: one
is a fisher, clever and capable, while the second obtains its
food by stealing from the other and does not go to sea. One
represents the immigrants of superior culture who came by sea,
the other the first people, aborigines, of lowly culture who
were quite unable to cope with the wiles and stratagems of
the people who had settled among them. In the Gazelle
Peninsula of New Britain, the dual groups are associated
with light and dark coconuts; affiliated with the former are
male objects and the clever bird, which is universally called
<i>taragau</i>, or a variant of that term. The bird of the other
moiety is named <i>malaba</i> or <i>manigulai</i>, and is associated with
female objects. The dark coconuts, the dark colour and
flattened noses of the women who were produced by their
transformation, and the projecting eyebrows of the <i>malaba</i> bird
and its human adherents seem to be records in the mythology
of the Bismarck Archipelago of the negroid (or, Rivers
suggests, an Australoid) character of the aboriginal population.
The light coconut which was changed into a light-coloured
woman seems to have preserved a tradition of the light colour
of the immigrants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary of
Culture Strata.</div>

<p>The autochthones of Melanesia were a dark-skinned and
ulotrichous people, who had neither a fear of the ghosts of
their dead nor a manes cult, but had a cult of
local spirits.  The Baining of the Gazelle Peninsula
of New Britain may be representatives of
a stage of Melanesian history earlier than the dual system; if
so, they probably represent in a modified form, the aboriginal
element. They are said to be completely devoid of any fear
of the dead.</p>

<p>The immigrants whose arrival caused the institution of the
dual system were a relatively fair people of superior culture
who interred their dead in a sitting position and feared their
ghosts. They first introduced the Austronesian language.</p>

<p>All subsequent migrations were of Austronesian-speaking
peoples from Indonesia. First came the kava-peoples in
various swarms, and more recently the betel-people.</p>

Culture.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Dress.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Houses.</div>

<p>Possibly New Caledonia shows the effects of relative
isolation more than other parts of Melanesia, but, except for
Polynesian influence (most directly recognisable in Fiji and
southern Melanesia), Melanesia may be regarded
as possessing a general culture with certain
characteristic features which may be thus summarised<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>.
The Melanesians are a noisy, excitable, demonstrative,
affectionate, cheery, passionate people. They could
not be hunters everywhere, as in most of the islands there is
no game, nor could they be pastors anywhere, as there are no
cattle; the only resources are fishing and agriculture. In the
larger islands there is usually a sharp distinction between the
coast people, who are mainly fishers, and the inlanders who
are agriculturalists; the latter are always by far the more
primitive, and in many cases are subservient to the former.
Both sexes work in the plantations. In parts of New Guinea
and the Western Solomons the sago palm is of great importance;
coconut palms grow on the shores of most islands,
and bananas, yams, bread-fruit, taro and sweet potatoes supply
abundant food. As for dress, the men occasionally wear
none, but usually have belts or bands, of bark-cloth, plaits, or
strings, and the women almost everywhere have
petticoats of finely shredded leaves. The skin
is decorated with scars in various patterns, and tattooing is
occasionally seen, the former being naturally characteristic of
the darker skinned people, and the latter of the lighter.
Every portion of the body is decorated in innumerable ways
with shells, teeth, feathers, leaves, flowers, and other objects,
and plaited bands encircle the neck, body, and limbs. Shell
necklaces, which constitute a kind of currency, and artificially
deformed boars' tusks are especially characteristic, though each
group usually has its peculiar ornaments, distinguishing it from
any other group. There is a great variety of houses. The
typical Melanesian house has a gable roof, the
ridge pole is supported by two main posts, side
walls are very low, and the ends are filled in with bamboo
screens. Pile dwellings are found in the Bismarck Archipelago,
the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, and some New Guinea
villages extend out into the sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Weapons.</div>

<p>The weapons typical of Melanesia are the club and the
spear (though the latter is not found in the Banks Islands),
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>each group and often each island possessing its own distinctive
pattern. Stone headed clubs are found
in New Guinea, New Britain and the New
Hebrides. The spears of the Solomon Islands are finely
decorated and have bone barbs; those of New Caledonia
are pointed with a sting-ray spine; those of the Admiralty
Islands have obsidian heads; and those of New Britain have
a human armbone at the butt end. The bow, the chief
weapon of the Papuans, occurs over the greater part of
Melanesia, though it is absent in S.E. New Guinea, and is
only used for hunting in the Admiralty Islands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Canoes etc.</div>

<p>The hollowed out tree trunk with or without a plank
gunwale is general, usually with a single outrigger, though
plank-built canoes occur in the Solomons,
characteristically ornamented with shell inlay.
Pottery is an important industry in parts of New Guinea and
in Fiji; it occurs also in New Caledonia, Espiritu Santo
(New Hebrides) and the Admiralty Islands. Bark-cloth is
made in most islands, but a loom for weaving leaf strips is
now found only in Santa Cruz.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Social Life.</div>

<p>A division of the community into two exogamous groups
is very widely spread, no intermarriage being permitted within
the group. Mother-right is prevalent, descent
and inheritance being counted on the mother's
side, while a man's property descends to his sister's children.
At the same time the mother is in no sense the head of the family;
the house is the father's, the garden may be his, the rule and
government are his, though the maternal uncle sometimes has
more authority than the father. The transition to father-right
has definitely occurred in various places, and is taking place
elsewhere; thus, in some of the New Hebrides, the father has
to buy off the rights of his wife's relations or his sister's
children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Secret Societies.</div>

<p>Chiefs exist everywhere, being endowed with religious
sanctity in Fiji, where they are regarded as the direct
descendants of the tribal ancestors. More often, a chief
holds his position solely owing to the fact that he has inherited
the cult of some powerful spirit, and his influence is not very
extensive. Probably everywhere public affairs are regulated
by discussion among the old or important men, and the more
primitive the society, the more power they possess. But the
most powerful institutions of all are the secret societies,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>occurring with certain exceptions throughout Melanesia.
These are accessible to men only, and the candidates
on initiation have to submit to treatment
which is often rough in the extreme. The members of the
societies are believed to be in close association with ghosts and
spirits, and exhibit themselves in masks and elaborate dresses
in which disguise they are believed by the uninitiated to be
supernatural beings. These societies do not practise any
secret cult, in fact all that the initiate appears to learn is that
the "ghosts" are merely his fellows in disguise, and that the
mysterious noises which herald their approach are produced
by the bull-roarer and other artificial means. These organisations
are most powerful agents for the maintenance of social
order and inflict punishment for breaches of customary law,
but they are often terrorising and blackmailing institutions.
Women are rigorously excluded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Clubs.</div>

<p>Other social factors of importance are the clubs, especially
in the New Hebrides and Banks Islands. These are a means
of attaining social rank. They are divided into
different grades, the members of which eat
together at their particular fire-place in the club-house. Each
rank has its insignia, sometimes human effigies, usually, but
wrongly, called "idols." Promotion from one grade to another
is chiefly a matter of payment, and few reach the highest.
Those who do so become personages of very great influence,
since no candidate can obtain promotion without their
permission.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion.</div>

<p>Totemism occurs in parts of New Guinea and elsewhere
and has marked socialising effects, as totemic solidarity takes
precedence of all other considerations, but it is
becoming obsolete. The most important religious
factor throughout Melanesia is the belief in a supernatural
power or influence, generally called <i>mana</i>. This is what
works to effect everything which is beyond the ordinary power
of man or outside the common processes of nature; but this
power, though in itself impersonal, is always connected with
some person who directs it; all spirits have it, ghosts generally,
and some men. A more or less developed ancestor cult is
also universally distributed. Human beings may become
beneficent or malevolent ghosts, but not every ghost becomes
an object of regard. The ghost who is worshipped is the
spirit of a man who in his lifetime had <i>mana</i>. Good and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
evil spirits independent of ancestors are also abundant everywhere.
There is no established priesthood, except in Fiji,
but as a rule, any man who knows the particular ritual suitable
to a definite spirit, acts as intermediary, and a man in communication
with a powerful spirit becomes a person of great
importance. Life after death is universally believed in, and
the soul is commonly pictured as undertaking a journey, beset
with various perils, to the abode of departed spirits, which is
usually represented as lying towards the west. As a rule
only the souls of brave men, or initiates, or men who have
died in fight, win through to the most desirable abode.
Magical practices occur everywhere for the gaining of benefits,
plenteous crops, good fishing, fine weather, rain, children or
success in love. Harmful magic for producing sickness or
death is equally universal<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>.</p>

<p>Returning to the Papuan lands proper, in the insular

entangled ethnical regions in the world. Here
are, no doubt, a few islands such as the Aru
group, mainly inhabited by full-blood Papuans,
men who furnished Wallace with the models on which he
built up his true Papuan type, which has since been vainly
assailed by so many later observers. But in others&mdash;Ceram,

A Region of
Transition by
Displacements
and Crossings.</div>

<p>From this apparently chaotic picture, which in some places,
such as Timor, presents every gradation from the full-blood
Papuan to the typical Malay, Crawfurd concluded that the
eastern section of Malaysia constituted a region
of transition between the yellowish-brown lank-haired
and the dark-brown or black mop-headed
stocks. In a sense this is true, but not in the sense
intended by Crawfurd, who by "transition" meant the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
actual passage by some process of development from type
to type independently of interminglings. But such extreme
transitions have nowhere taken place spontaneously, so to say,
and in any case could never have been brought about in a
small zoological area presenting everywhere the same climatic
conditions. Biological types may be, and have been, modified
in different environments, arctic, temperate, or tropical zones,
but not in the same zone, and if two such marked types as
the Mongol and the Negro are now found juxtaposed in
the Malaysian tropical zone, the fact must be explained by
migrations and displacements, while the intermediate forms
are to be attributed to secular intermingling of the extremes.
Why should a man, passing from one side to another of an
island 10 or 20 miles long, be transformed from a sleek-haired
brown to a frizzly-haired black, or from a mercurial laughter-loving
Papuan to a Malayan "slow in movement and thoroughly
phlegmatic in disposition, rarely seen to laugh or become
animated in conversation, with expression generally of vague
wonder or weary sadness"<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Papuan and
Malay
Contrasts.</div>

<p>Wallace's classical description of these western Papuans,
who are here in the very cradleland of the race, can never
lose its charm, and its accuracy has been fully
confirmed by all later observers. "The typical
Papuan race," he writes, "is in many respects
the very opposite of the Malay. The colour of the body is
a deep sooty-brown or black, sometimes approaching, but
never quite equalling, the jet-black of some negro races.
The hair is very peculiar, being harsh, dry, and frizzly, growing
in little tufts or curls, which in youth are very short and
compact, but afterwards grow out to a considerable length,
forming the compact, frizzled mop which is the Papuan's pride
and glory.... The moral characteristics of the Papuan appear
to me to separate him as distinctly from the Malay as do his
form and features. He is impulsive and demonstrative in
speech and action.  His emotions and passions express
themselves in shouts and laughter, in yells and frantic
leapings.... The Papuan has a greater feeling for art than
the Malay. He decorates his canoe, his house, and almost
every domestic utensil with elaborate carving, a habit which
is rarely found among tribes of the Malay race.  In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
affections and moral sentiments, on the other hand, the
Papuans seem very deficient. In the treatment of their
children they are often violent and cruel, whereas the Malays
are almost invariably kind and gentle."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethnical and
Biological
Divides.</div>

<p>The ethnological parting-line between the Malayan and
Papuasian races, as first laid down by Wallace, nearly coincides
with his division between the Indo-Malayan
and Austro-Malayan floras and faunas,
the chief differences being the positions of Sumbawa
and Celebes. Both of these islands are excluded from
the Papuasian realm, but included in the Austro-Malayan
zoological and botanical regions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Negritoes.</div>

<p>Recent discoveries and investigations of the pygmy populations
on the eastern border of the Indian Ocean tend to
show that the problem is by no means simple.
Already two main stocks are recognised, differentiated
by wavy and curly hair and dolichocephaly in the
Sakai, and so-called woolly hair in the Andamanese Islanders,
Semang (Malay Peninsula) and Aeta (Philippines), combined
with mesaticephaly or low brachycephaly. In East Sumatra
and Celebes a short, curly-haired dark-skinned people occur,
racially akin to the Sakai, and Moszkowski suggests that the
same element occupied Geelvink Bay (Netherlands New
Guinea). These with the Vedda of Ceylon, and some jungle
tribes of the Deccan, represent remnants of a once widely
distributed pre-Dravidian race, which is also supposed to form
the chief element in the Australians<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Andamanese.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Stone Age.</div>

<p>The "Mincopies," as the Andamanese used to be called,
nobody seems to know why, were visited in 1893 by Louis
Lapicque, who examined a large kitchen-midden
near Port Blair, but some distance from the
present coast, hence of great age<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>. Nevertheless
he failed to find any worked stone implements, although flint
occurs in the island. Indeed, chipped or flaked flints, now
replaced by broken glass, were formerly used for shaving and
scarification. But, as the present natives use only fishbones,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>shells, and wood, Lapicque somewhat hastily concluded that
these islanders, like some other primitive groups,
have never passed through a Stone Age at all.
The shell-mounds have certainly yielded an arrow-head and
polished adze "indistinguishable from any of the European or
Indian celts of the so-called Neolithic period<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>." But there is no
reason to think that the archipelago was ever occupied by a
people different from its present inhabitants. Hence we may
suppose that their ancestors arrived in their Stone Age, but
afterwards ceased to make stone implements, as less handy
for their purposes and more difficult to make than the shell
or bone-tipped weapons and the nets with which they capture
game and fish more readily "than the most skilful fisherman
with hook and line<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>." Similarly they would seem to have
long lost the art of making fire, having once obtained it from
a still active volcano in the neighbouring Barren Island<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Personal
Appearance.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Social Life.</div>

<p>The inhabitants of the Andaman Islands range in colour
from bronze to sooty black. Their hair is extremely frizzly,
seeming to grow in spiral tufts and is seldom
more than 5 inches long when untwisted. The
women usually shave their heads. Their height
is about 1.48 m. (4 ft. 10&frac12; in.), with well-proportioned body
and small hands. The cephalic index averages 82. The
face is broad at the cheek-bones, the eyes are prominent, the
nose is much sunken at the root but straight and small; the
lips are full but not thick, the chin is small but not retreating,
nor do the jaws project. The natives are characterised by
honesty, frankness, politeness, modesty, conjugal fidelity,
respect for elders and real affection between relatives and
friends. The women are on an equal footing with the men
and do their full share of work. The food is mainly fish
(obtained by netting, spearing or shooting with bow and
arrow), wild yams, turtle, pig and honey. They do not till
the soil or keep domestic animals. Instead of clothing both
sexes wear belts, necklaces, leg-bands, arm-bands etc. made
of bones, wood and shell, the women wearing in addition
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>a rudimentary leaf apron. When fully dressed the men wear
bunches of shredded Pandanus leaf at wrists and knees, and
a circlet of the same leaf folded on the head. They make
canoes, some of which have an outrigger, but never venture
far from the shore. They usually live in small encampments
round an oval dancing ground, their simple huts
are open in front and at the sides, or in a large
communal hut in which each family has its own particular
space, the bachelors and spinsters having theirs. A family
consists of a man and his wife and such of their children, own
and adopted, as have not passed the period of the ceremonies
of adolescence. Between that period and marriage the boys
and girls reside in the bachelors' and spinsters' quarters
respectively. A man is not regarded as an independent
member of the community till he is married and has a child.
There is no organised polity. Generally one man excels the
rest in hunting, warfare, wisdom and kindliness, and he is
deferred to, and becomes, in a sense, chief. A regular feature
of Andamanese social life is the meeting at intervals between
two or more communities. A visit of a few days is paid and
presents are exchanged between hosts and guests, the time
being spent in hunting, feasting and dancing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion.</div>

<p>No forms of worship have been noticed, but there is a belief
in various kinds of spirits, the most important of whom is Biliku,
usually regarded as female, who is identified with
the north-east monsoon and is paired with Tarai
the south-west monsoon. Biliku and Tarai are the producers of
rain, storms, thunder and lightning. Fire was stolen from Biliku.
There is always great fluidity in native beliefs, so some tribes
regard Puluga (Biliku) as a male. Three things make Biliku
angry and cause her to send storms; melting or burning of bees-wax,
interfering in any way with a certain number of plants, and
killing a cicada or making a noise during the time the cicadae
are singing. A. R. Brown<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> gives an interesting explanation
of this curious belief. Biliku is supposed to have a human
form but nobody ever sees her. Her origin is unknown.
The idea of her being a creator is local and is probably
secondary, she does not concern herself with human actions
other than those noted above.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Speech.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Method of
Counting.</div>

<p>E. H. Man has carefully studied and reduced to writing the
Andamanese language, of which there are at least nine distinct
varieties, corresponding to as many tribal groups.
It has no clear affinities to any other tongue<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>,
the supposed resemblances to Dravidian and Australian being
extremely slight, if not visionary. Its phonetic system is
astonishingly rich (no less than 24 vowels and 17 consonants,
but no sibilants), while the arithmetic stops at <i>two</i>. Nobody
ever attempts to count in any way beyond <i>ten</i>, which is reached
by a singular process. First the nose is tapped with the
finger-tips of either hand, beginning with the
little finger, and saying <i>&uacute;bat&uacute;l</i> (one), then <i>&iacute;kp&oacute;r</i>
(two) with the next, after which each successive
tap makes <i>ank&aacute;</i>, "and this." When the thumb of the second
hand is reached, making <i>ten</i>, both hands are brought together
to indicate 5 + 5, and the sum is clenched with the word <i>&agrave;rd&uacute;ru</i>
= "all." But this feat is exceptional, and usually after <i>two</i>
you get only words answering to several, many, numerous,
countless, which flight of imagination is reached at about 6 or 7.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grammatical
Structure.</div>

<p>Yet with their infantile arithmetic these paradoxical
islanders have contrived to develop an astonishingly intricate
form of speech characterised by an absolutely bewildering
superfluity of pronominal and other elements. Thus the possessive
pronouns have as many as sixteen possible variants
according to the class of noun (human objects, parts of the
body, degrees of kinship, etc.) with which they are in agreement.
For instance, <i>my</i> is <i>d&iacute;a</i>, <i>d&oacute;t</i>, <i>d&oacute;ng</i>, <i>dig</i>,
<i>dab</i>, <i>dar</i>, <i>d&aacute;k&agrave;</i>, <i>d&oacute;to</i>, <i>dai</i>, <i>d&aacute;r</i>, <i>ad</i>, <i>ad-en</i>, <i>deb</i>,
with <i>man</i>, <i>head</i>, <i>wrist</i>, <i>mouth</i>, <i>father</i>, <i>son</i>, <i>step-son</i>,
<i>wife</i>, etc. etc.; and so with <i>thy</i>, <i>his</i>, <i>our</i>, <i>your</i>, <i>their</i>!
This grouping of nouns in classes is analogous to the Bantu
system, and it is curious to note that the number of classes is
about the same. On the other hand there is a wealth of
postfixes attached as in normal agglutinating forms of speech,
so that "in adding their affixes they follow the principles of
the ordinary agglutinative tongues; in adding their prefixes
they follow the well-defined principles of the South African
tongues. Hitherto, as far as I know, the two principles in full
play have never been found together in any other language....
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
In Andamanese both are fully developed, so much so as to interfere
with each other's grammatical functions<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>." The result
often is certain <i>sesquipedalia verba</i> comparable in length to
those of the American polysynthetic languages. A savage
people, who can hardly count beyond two, possessed of about
the most intricate language spoken by man, is a psychological
puzzle which I cannot profess to fathom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Semangs.</div>

<p>In the Malay Peninsula the indigenous element is certainly
the Negrito, who, known by many names&mdash;Semang, Udai,
Pangan, Hami, Menik or Mandi&mdash;forms a single
ethnical group presenting some striking analogies
with the Andamanese. But, surrounded from time out
of mind by Malay peoples, some semi-civilised, some nearly
as wild as themselves, but all alike slowly crowding them out
of the land, these aborigines have developed defensive qualities
unneeded by the more favoured insular Negritoes, while
their natural development has been arrested at perhaps a
somewhat lower plane of culture. In fact, doomed to extinction
before their time came, they never have had a chance
in the race, as Hugh Clifford sings in <i>The Song of the Last
Semangs</i>:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physical
Appearance.</div>

<p>In physical features they in many respects resemble the
Andamanese. Their hair is short, universally
woolly and black, the skin colour dark chocolate
brown approximating to glossy black<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>, sometimes
with a reddish tinge<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>. There is very little evidence
for the stature but the 17 males measured by Annandale and
Robinson<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> averaged 1.52 m. (5 ft. 0&frac14; in.). The average
cephalic index is about 78 to 79, extremes ranging from 74
to 84. The face is round, the forehead rounded, narrow and
projecting, or as it were "swollen." The nose is short and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
flattened, with remarkable breadth and distended nostrils.
The nasal index of five adult males was 101.2<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>. The cheekbones
are broad and the jaws often protrude slightly; the
lips are as a rule thick. Martin remarks that characteristic
both of Semang and Sakai<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> is the great thickening of the
integumental part of the upper lip, the whole mouth region
projecting from the lower edge of the nose. This convexity
occurs in 79 per cent., and is well shown in his photographs<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>.</p>

<p>Hugh Clifford, who has been intimately associated with
the "Orang-utan" (Wild-men) as the Malays often call them,
describes those of the Plus River valley as "like African
Negroes seen through the reverse end of a field-glass. They
are sooty-black in colour; their hair is short and woolly, clinging
to the scalp in little crisp curls; their noses are flat, their
lips protrude, and their features are those of the pure negroid
type. They are sturdily built and well set upon their legs,
but in stature little better than dwarfs. They live by hunting,
and have no permanent dwellings, camping in little family
groups wherever, for the moment, game is most plentiful<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Usages.</div>

<p>Their shelters&mdash;huts they cannot be called&mdash;are exactly
like the frailest of the Andamanese, mere lean-to's of matted
palm-leaves crazily propped on rough uprights;
clothes they have next to none, and their
food is chiefly yams and other jungle roots, fish from the
stream, and sun-dried monkey, venison and other game, this
term having an elastic meaning. Salt, being rarely obtainable,
is a great luxury, as amongst almost all wild tribes.
They are a nomadic people living by collecting and hunting;
the wilder ones will often not remain longer than three days
in one place. Very few have taken to agriculture. They
make use of bamboo rafts for drifting down stream but have
no canoes. All men are on an equal footing, but each tribe
has a head, who exercises authority. Division of labour is
fairly even between men and women. The men hunt, and
the women build the shelters and cook the food. They are
strictly monogamous and faithful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>All the faculties are sharpened mainly in the quest of
food and of means to elude the enemy now closing round
their farthest retreats in the upland forests. When hard
pressed and escape seems impossible, they will climb trees
and stretch rattan ropes from branch to branch where these
are too wide apart to be reached at a bound, and along such
frail a&euml;rial bridges women and all will pass with their cooking-pots
and other effects, with their babies also at the breast,
and the little ones clinging to their mother's heels. For like
the Andamanese they love their women-folk and children, and
in this way rescue them from the Malay raiders and slavers.
But unless the British raj soon intervenes their fate is sealed.
They may slip from the Malays, but not from their own
traitorous kinsmen, who often lead the hunt, and squat all
night long on the tree tops, calling one to another and signalling
from these look-outs when the leaves rustle and the
rattans are heaved across, so that nothing can be done, and
another family group is swept away into bondage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Speech.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Stone Age.</div>

<p>From their physical resemblance, undoubted common
descent, and geographical proximity, one might also expect
to find some affinity in the speech of the Andaman
and Malay Negritoes. But H. Clifford,
who made a special study of the dialects on the mainland,
discovered no points of contact between them and any other
linguistic group<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>. This, however, need cause no surprise,
being in no discordance with recognised principles. As in
the Andamans, stone implements have been
found in the Peninsula, and specimens are now
in the Pitt-Rivers collection at Oxford<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>. But the present
aborigines do not make or use such tools, and there is good
reason for thinking that they were the work of their ancestors,
arriving, as in the Andamans, in the remote past. Hence the
two groups have been separated for many thousands of years,
and their speech has diverged too widely to be now traced
back to a common source.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Aetas.</div>

<p>With the Negritoes of the Philippines we enter a region
of almost hopeless ethnical complications<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>, amid which, however,
the dark dwarfish <i>Aeta</i> peoples crop out almost
everywhere as the indigenous element. The
Aeta live in the mountainous districts of the larger islands,
and in some of the smaller islands of the Philippines, and
the name is conveniently extended to the various groups of
Philippine Negritoes, many of whom show the results of
mixture with other peoples. Their hair is universally woolly,
usually of a dirty black colour, often sun-burnt on the top
to a reddish brown. The skin is dark chocolate brown rather
than black, sometimes with a yellowish tinge. The average
stature of 48 men was 1.46 m. (4 ft. 9 in.), but showed considerable
range. The typical nose is broad, flat, and bridgeless,
with prominent arched nostrils, the average nasal index for
males being 102, and for females 105<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>. The lips are thick,
but not protruding, sometimes showing a pronounced convexity
between the upper lip and the nose.</p>

<p>John Foreman<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> noted the curious fact that the Aeta were
recognised as the owners of the soil long after the arrival of
the Malayan intruders.</p>

<p>"For a long time they were the sole masters of Luzon
Island, where they exercised seignorial rights over the Tagalogs
and other immigrants, until these arrived in such numbers,
that the Negritoes were forced to the highlands.</p>

<p>"The taxes imposed upon the primitive Malay settlers by
the Negritoes were levied in kind, and, when payment was
refused, they swooped down in a posse, and carried off the
head of the defaulter. Since the arrival of the Spaniards
terror of the white man has made them take definitely to the
mountains, where they appear to be very gradually decreasing<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Head-hunters.</div>

<p>At first sight it may seem unaccountable that a race of
such extremely low intellect should be able to assert their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>supremacy in this way over the intruding Malayans, assumed
to be so much their superiors in physical and mental qualities.
But it has to be considered that the invasions took place in very
remote times, ages before the appearance on the scene of the
semi-civilised Muhammadan Malays of history. Whether of
Indonesian or of what is called "Malay" stock, the intruders
were rude Oceanic peoples, who in the prehistoric period,
prior to the spread of civilising Hindu or Moslem influences
in Malaysia, had scarcely advanced in general culture much
beyond the indigenous Papuan and Negrito populations of
that region. Even at present the Gaddanes, Itaves, Igorrotes,
and others of Luzon are mere savages, at the
head-hunting stage, quite as wild as, and perhaps
even more ferocious than any of the Aetas.
Indeed we are told that in some districts the Negrito and
Igorrote tribes keep a regular Debtor and Creditor account
of heads. Wherever the vendetta still prevails, all alike live
in a chronic state of tribal warfare; periodical head-hunting
expeditions are organised by the young men, to present the
bride's father with as many grim trophies as possible in proof
of their prowess, the victims being usually taken by surprise
and stricken down with barbarous weapons, such as a long
spear with tridented tips, or darts and arrows carrying at the
point two rows of teeth made of flint or sea-shells. To avoid
these attacks some, like the Central Sudanese Negroes, live
in cabins on high posts or trees 60 to 70 feet from the
ground, and defend themselves by showering stones on the
marauders.</p>

<p>A physical peculiarity of the full-blood Negritoes, noticed
by J. Montano<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>, is the large, clumsy foot, turned slightly
inwards, a trait characteristic also of the African Negrilloes;
but in the Aeta the effect is exaggerated by the abnormal
divergence of the great toe, as amongst the Annamese.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New Guinea
Pygmies.</div>

<p>The presence of a pygmy element in the population of
New Guinea had long been suspected, but the actual existence
of a pygmy people was first discovered
by the British Ornithologists' Union Expedition,
1910, at the source of the Mimika river in the
Nassau range<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>The description of these people, the Tapiro, is as follows.
Their stature averages 1.449 m. (4 ft. 9 in.) ranging from
1.326 m. (4 ft. 4&frac12; in.) to 1.529 (5 ft. 0&frac14; in.). The skull is very
variable giving indices from 66.9 to 85.1. The skin colour
is lighter than that of the neighbouring Papuans, some individuals
being almost yellow. The nose is straight, and though
described as "very wide at the nostrils," the mean of the
indices is only 83, the extremes being 65.5 and 94. The eyes
are noticeably larger and rounder than those of Papuans, and
the upper lip of many of the men is long and curiously convex.
A Negrito element has also been recognised in the
Mafulu people investigated by R. W. Williamson in the
Mekeo District<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>, here mixed with Papuan and Papuo-Melanesian.
Their stature ranges from 1.47 m. (4 ft. 10 in.) to
1.63 m. (5 ft. 4 in.). The average cephalic index is 80 ranging
from 74.7 to 86.8. The skin colour is dark sooty brown and
the hair, though usually brown or black, is often very much
lighter, "not what we in Europe should call dark." The
average nasal index is 84 with extremes of 71.4 and 100.
Also partly of Negrito origin are the P&#277;s&#277;g&#277;m  of the upper
waters of the Lorentz river<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Negrito
Culture.</div>

<p>All these Negrito peoples, as has been pointed out, show
considerable diversity in physical characters, none of the
existing groups, with the exception of the
Andamanese, appearing to be homogeneous
as regards cephalic or nasal index, while the
stature, though always low, shows considerable range. They
have certain cultural features in common<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>, and these as a rule
differentiate them from their neighbours. They seldom
practise any deformation of the person, such as tattooing or
scarification, though the Tapiro and Mafulu wear a nose-stick.
They are invariably collectors and hunters, never,
unless modified by contact with other peoples, undertaking
any cultivation of the soil. Their huts are simple, the pile
dwellings of the Tapiro being evidently copied from their
neighbours. All possess the bow and arrow, though only
the Semang and Aeta use poison. The Andamanese appear
to be one of the very few peoples who possess fire but do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
not know how to make it afresh. There seems a certain
amount of evidence that the Negrito method of making fire
was that of splitting a dry stick, keeping the ends open by
a piece of wood or stone placed in the cleft, stuffing some
tinder into the narrow part of the slit and then drawing a
strip of rattan to and fro across the spot until a spark sets
fire to the tinder<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>. The social structure is everywhere very
simple. The social unit appears to be the family and the
power of the headman is very limited. Strict monogamy
seems to prevail even where, as among the Aeta, polygyny
is not prohibited. The dead are buried, but the bodies of
those whom it is wished to honour are placed on platforms
or on trees.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Tasmanians.</div>

<p>Related in certain physical characters to the pygmy
Negritoes, although not of pygmy proportions<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>, were the
aborigines of Tasmania, but their racial affinities
are much disputed. Huxley thought
they showed some resemblance to the inhabitants
of New Caledonia and the Andaman Islands, but
Flower was disposed to bring them into closer connection
with the Papuans or Melanesians. The leading anthropologists
in France do not accept either of these views. Topinard
states that there is no close alliance between the New Caledonians
and the Tasmanians, while Quatrefages and Hamy
remark that "from whatever point of view we look at it, the
Tasmanian race presents special characters, so that it is quite
impossible to discover any well-defined affinities with any
other existing race." Sollas, reviewing these conflicting
opinions, concludes that "this probably represents the prevailing
opinion of the present day<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>."</p>

<p>The Tasmanians were of medium height, the average for
the men being 1.661 m. (5 ft. 5&frac12; in.) with a range from 1.548 m.
to 1.732 m. (5 ft. 1 in. to 5 ft. 8 in.); the average height for
women being 1.503 m. (4 ft. 11 in.) with a range from 1.295 m.
to 1.630 m. (4 ft. 3 in. to 5 ft. 4&frac14; in.). The skin colour was
almost black with a brown tinge. The eyes were small and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
deep set beneath prominent overhanging brow-ridges. The
nose was short and broad, with a deep notch at the root and
widely distended nostrils. The skull was dolichocephalic or
low mesaticephalic, with an average index of 75, of peculiar
outline when viewed from above. Other peculiarities were
the possession of the largest teeth, especially noticeable in
comparison with the small jaw, and the smallest known
cranial capacity (averaging 1199 c.c. for both sexes, falling in
the women to 1093 c.c.).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tasmanian
Culture.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Undeveloped
Speech.</div>

<p>The aboriginal Tasmanians stood even at a lower level
of culture than the Australians. At the occupation the
scattered bands, with no hereditary chiefs or
social organisation, numbered altogether 2000
souls at most, speaking several distinct dialects,
whether of one or more stock languages is uncertain. In the
absence of sibilants and some other features they resembled
the Australian, but were of ruder or less developed structure,
and so imperfect that according to Joseph Milligan, our best
authority on the subject, "they observed no settled order or
arrangement of words in the construction of their
sentences, but conveyed in a supplementary
fashion by tone, manner, and gesture those
modifications of meaning which we express by mood, tense,
number, etc.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>" Abstract terms were rare, and for every variety
of gum-tree or wattle-tree there was a name, but no word for
"tree" in general, or for qualities, such as hard, soft, warm,
cold, long, short, round, etc. Anything hard was "like a
stone," round "like the moon," and so on, "usually suiting
the action to the word, and confirming by some sign the
meaning to be understood."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fire-making,
Tools and
Weapons.</div>

<p>They made fire by the stick and groove method, but their
acquaintance with the fire-drill is uncertain<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>. The stone
implements are the subject of much discussion.
A great number are so rude and uncouth that,
taken alone, we should have little reason to
suspect that they had been chipped by man: some, on the other
hand, show signs of skilful working. They were formerly
classed as "eoliths" and compared to the plateau implements
of Kent and Sussex, but the comparison cannot be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
sustained<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>. Sollas illustrates an implement "delusively similar
to the head of an axe" and notes its resemblance to a
Levallois flake (Acheulean). J. P. Johnson<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> points out the
general likeness to pre-Aurignacian forms and there is a
remarkable similarity of certain examples to Mousterian
types. Weapons were of wood, and consisted of spears
pointed and hardened in the fire, and a club or waddy, about
two feet long, sometimes knobbed at one end; the range is
said to have been about 40 yards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diet.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Dwellings.</div>

<p>In the native diet were included "snakes, lizards, grubs
and worms," besides the opossum, wombat, kangaroo, birds
and fishes, roots, seeds and fruits, but not human flesh, at
least normally. Like the Bushmen, they were
gross feeders, consuming enormous quantities
of food when they could get it, and the case is mentioned of
a woman who was seen to eat from 50 to 60 eggs of the
sooty petrel (larger than a duck's), besides a double allowance
of bread, at the station on Flinders Island. They had frail
bundles of bark made fast with thongs or rushes, half float,
half boat, to serve as canoes, but no permanent
abodes or huts, beyond branches of trees lashed
together, supported by stakes, and disposed crescent-shape
with the convex side to windward. On the uplands and
along the sea-shore they took refuge in caves, rock-shelters
and natural hollows. Usually the men went naked, the women
wore a loose covering of skins, and personal ornamentation
was limited to cosmetics of red ochre, plumbago, and powdered
charcoal, with occasionally a necklace of shells strung on a
fibrous twine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extinction.</div>

<p>Being merely hunters and collectors, with the arrival of
English colonists their doom was sealed. "Only in rare
instances can a race of hunters contrive to
co-exist with an agricultural people. When the
hunting ground of a tribe is restricted owing to its partial
occupation by the new arrivals, the tribe affected is compelled
to infringe on the boundaries of its neighbours: this is to
break the most sacred 'law of the Jungle,' and inevitably
leads to war: the pressure on one boundary is propagated
to the next, the ancient state of equilibrium is profoundly
disturbed, and inter-tribal feuds become increasingly frequent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
A bitter feeling is naturally aroused against the original
offenders, the alien colonists; misunderstandings of all kinds
inevitably arise, leading too often to bloodshed, and ending
in a general conflict between natives and colonists, in which
the former, already weakened by disagreements among themselves,
must soon succumb. So it was in Tasmania." After
the war of 1825 to 1831 the few wretched survivors, numbering
about 200, were gathered together into a settlement, and
from 1834 onwards every effort was made for their welfare,
"but 'the white man's civilisation proved scarcely less fatal
than the white man's bullet,' and in 1877, with the death of
Truganini, the last survivor, the race became extinct<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>."</p>

the characters so variable in New Guinea that he was unable to use it as a racial
test. In the New Hebrides, Louisiades, and Bismarck group also he found many
of the natives to be broad-headed, with indices as high as 80 and 85; and even in

dolichocephaly predominates (<i>The Solomon Islands</i>, 1887, pp. 112, 114). Thus

<div class="sidenote">South Mongol
Domain.</div>

<p>The Mongolian stock may be divided into two main
branches<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>: the <i>Mongolo-Tatar</i>, of the western area, and the
<i>Tibeto-Indo-Chinese</i> of the eastern area, the latter extending
into a secondary branch, <i>Oceanic Mongols</i>. These two, that
is, the main and secondary branch, which jointly occupy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>the greater part of south-east Asia with most of Malaysia,
Madagascar, the Philippines and Formosa, will
form the subject of the present and following
chapters. Allowing for encroachments and overlappings,
especially in Manchuria and North Tibet, the
northern "divide" towards the Mongolo-Tatar domain is
roughly indicated by the Great Wall and the Kuen-lun range
westwards to the Hindu-Kush, and towards the south-west
by the Himalayas from the Hindu-Kush eastwards to Assam.
The Continental section thus comprises the whole of China
proper and Indo-China, together with a great part of Tibet
with Little Tibet (Baltistan and Ladakh), and the Himalayan
uplands including their southern slopes. This section is
again separated from the Oceanic section by the Isthmus of
Kra&mdash;the Malay Peninsula belonging ethnically to the insular
Malay world. "I believe," writes Warington Smyth, "that
the Malay never really extended further south than the Kra
isthmus<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tibet, the
Mongol
Cradle-land.</div>

<p>From the considerations advanced in <i>Ethnology</i>, Chap.
XII., it seems a reasonable assumption that the lacustrine
Tibetan tableland with its Himalayan escarpments, all standing
in pleistocene times at a considerably lower level
than at present, was the cradle of the Mongol
division of mankind. Here were found all the
natural conditions favourable to the development of a new
variety of the species moving from the tropics northwards&mdash;ample
space such as all areas of marked specialisation seem
to require; a different and cooler climate than that of the
equatorial region, though, thanks to its then lower elevation,
warmer than that of the bleak and now barely inhabitable
Tibetan plateau; extensive plains, nowhere perhaps too
densely wooded, intersected by ridges of moderate height,
and diversified by a lacustrine system far more extensive than
that revealed by the exploration of modern travellers<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, which are not matter of mere
speculation, but to be directly inferred from the observations
of intelligent explorers and of trained Anglo-Indian surveyors,
it would seem not only probable but inevitable that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
pleistocene Indo-Malayan should become modified and
improved in his new and more favourable Central Asiatic
environment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stone Age in
Tibet.</div>

<p>Later, with the gradual upheaval of the land to a mean
altitude of some 14,000 feet above sea-level, the climate
deteriorated, and the present somewhat rude and rugged
inhabitants of Tibet are to be regarded as the outcome of
slow adaptation to their slowly changing surroundings since the
occupation of the country by the Indo-Malayan pleistocene
precursor. To this precursor Tibet was accessible either
from India or from Indo-China, and although
few of his implements have yet been reported
from the plateau, it is certain that Tibet has
passed through the Stone as well as the Metal Ages. In
Bogle's time "thunder-stones" were still used for tonsuring
the lamas, and even now stone cooking-pots are found
amongst the shepherds of the uplands, although they are
acquainted both with copper and iron. In India also and
Indo-China palaeoliths of rude type occur at various points&mdash;Arcot,
the Narbada gravels, Mirzapur<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>, the Irawadi valley
and the Shan territory&mdash;as if to indicate the routes followed
by early man in his migrations from Indo-Malaysia northwards.</p>

<p>Thus, where man is silent the stones speak, and so old are
these links of past and present that amongst the Shans, as in
ancient Greece, their origin being entirely forgotten, they are
often mounted as jewellery and worn as charms against mishaps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Primitive
Mongol Type.</div>

<p>Usually the Mongols proper, that is, the steppe nomads
who have more than once overrun half the eastern hemisphere,
are taken as the typical and original stem of the Mongolian
stock. But if Ch. de Ujfalvy's views can be accepted this
honour will now have to be transferred to the
Tibetans, who still occupy the supposed cradle
of the race. This veteran student of the Central
Asiatic peoples describes two Mongol types, a northern round-headed
and a southern long-headed, and thinks that the latter,
which includes "the Ladakhi, the Champas and Tibetans
proper," was "the primitive Mongol type<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Balti and
Ladakhi.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Balti Type and
Origins.</div>

<p>Owing to the political seclusion of Tibet, the race has
hitherto been studied chiefly in outlying provinces beyond the
frontiers, such as Ladakh, Baltistan, and Sikkim<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>,
that is, in districts where mixture with other
races may be suspected.  Indeed de Ujfalvy,
who has made a careful survey of Baltistan and Ladakh,
assures us that, while the Ladakhi represent two varieties of
Asiatic man with ceph. index 77, the Balti are not Tibetans
or Mongols at all, but descendants of the historical Sacae,
although now of Tibetan speech and Moslem faith<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>. They
are of the mean height or slightly above it, with rather low
brow, very prominent superciliary arches, deep
depression at nasal root, thick curved eyebrows,
long, straight or arched nose, thick lips, oval
chin, small cheek-bones, small flat ears, straight eyes, very
black and abundant ringletty (<i>boucl&eacute;</i>) hair, full beard, usually
black and silky, robust hairy body, small hands and feet, and
long head (index 72). In such characters it is impossible to
recognise the Mongol, and the contrast is most striking with
the neighbouring Ladakhi, true Mongols, as shown by their
slightly raised superciliary arches, square and scarcely curved
eyebrows, slant eyes, large prominent cheek-bones, lank and
coarse hair, yellowish and nearly hairless body.</p>

<p>Doubtless there has been a considerable intermingling of
Balti and Ladakhi, and in recent times still more of Balti
and Dards (Hindu-Kush "Aryans"), whence Leitner's view
that the Balti are Dards at a remote period conquered by the
Bh&oacute;ts (Tibetans), losing their speech with their independence.
But of all these peoples the Balti were in former times the
most civilised, as shown by the remarkable rock-carvings still
found in the country, and attributed by the present inhabitants
to a long vanished race. Some of these carvings represent
warriors mounted and on foot, the resemblance being often
very striking between them and the persons figured on the
coins of the Sacae kings both in their physical appearance,
attitudes, arms, and accoutrements. The Balti are still
famous horsemen, and with them is said to have originated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
the game of polo, which has thence spread to the surrounding
peoples as far as Chitral and Irania.</p>

<p>From all these considerations it is inferred that the Balti
are the direct descendants of the Sacae, who invaded India
about 90 <small>B.C.</small>, not from the west (the Kabul valley) as generally
stated, but from the north over the Karakorum Passes leading
directly to Baltistan<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>. Thus lives again a name renowned in
antiquity, and another of those links is established between
the past and the present, which it is the province of the
historical ethnologist to rescue from oblivion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Tibetans
Proper.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Bod-pa, Dru-pa,
Tanguts.</div>

<p>In Tibet proper the ethnical relations have been confused
by the loose way tribal and even national names are referred
to by Prjevalsky and some other modern explorers.
It should therefore be explained that
three somewhat distinct branches of the race
have to be carefully distinguished: 1. The <i>Bod-pa</i><a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>, "Bodmen,"
the settled and more or less civilised section, who
occupy most of the southern and more fertile provinces of
which Lhasa is the capital, who till the land,
live in towns, and have passed from the tribal
to the civic state. 2. The <i>Dru-pa</i><a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>, peaceful
though semi-nomadic pastoral tribes, who live in tents on the
northern plateaux, over 15,000 feet above sea-level. 3. The
<i>Tanguts</i><a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>, restless, predatory tribes, who hover about the
north-eastern borderland between Koko-nor and Kansu.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>All these are true Tibetans, speak the Tibetan language,
and profess one or other of the two national religions,
<i>Bonbo</i> and Lamaism (the Tibetan form of Buddhism). But
the original type is best preserved, not amongst the cultured
Bod-pa, who in many places betray a considerable admixture
both of Chinese and Hindu elements, but amongst the
Dru-pa, who on their bleak upland steppes have for ages had
little contact with the surrounding Mongolo-Turki populations.
They are described by W. W. Rockhill from personal
observation as about five feet five inches high, and round-headed,
with wavy hair, clear-brown and even hazel eye,
cheek-bone less high than the Mongol, thick nose, depressed
at the root, but also prominent and even aquiline and narrow
but with broad nostrils, large-lobed ears standing out to a less
degree than the Mongol, broad mouth, long black hair, thin
beard, generally hairless body, broad shoulders, very small
calves, large foot, coarse hand, skin coarse and greasy and of
light brown colour, though "frequently nearly white, but when
exposed to the weather a dark brown, nearly the colour of our
American Indians. Rosy cheeks are quite common amongst
the younger women<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>."</p>

<p>Some of these characters&mdash;wavy hair, aquiline nose,
hazel eye, rosy cheeks&mdash;are not Mongolic, and despite
W. W. Rockhill's certificate of racial purity, one is led to
suspect a Caucasic strain, perhaps through the neighbouring
Salars. These are no doubt sometimes called Kara-Tangutans,
"Black Tangutans," from the colour of their tents,
but we learn from Potanin, who visited them in 1885<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>, that they
are Muhammadans of Turki stock and speech, and we already
know<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> that from a remote period the Turki people were in close
contact with Caucasians. The Salars pitch their tents on the
banks of the Khitai and other Yang-tse-Kiang headstreams.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bhotiyas.</div>

<p>That the national name Bod-pa must be of considerable
antiquity is evident from the Sanskrit expression <i>Bhotiya</i>,
derived from it, and long applied by the
Hindus collectively to all southern Tibetans,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
but especially to those of the Himalayan slopes, such as the
Rongs (Lepchas) of Sikkim and the <i>Lho-pa</i> dominant in
Bhutan, properly <i>Bh&oacute;t-&aacute;nt</i>, that is, "Land's End"&mdash;the
extremity of Tibet. Eastwards also the Tibetan race stretches
far beyond the political frontiers into the Koko-nor region
(Tanguts), and the Chinese province of Se-chuan, where they
are grouped with all the other Si-fan aborigines. Towards
the south-east are the kindred <i>Tawangs</i>, <i>Mishmi</i>, <i>Miri</i>, <i>Abor</i><a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>,
<i>Daflas</i>, and many others about the Assam borderlands, all of
whom may be regarded as true Bhotiyas in the wild state.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prehistoric
Expansion of
the Tibetan
Race.</div>

<p>Through these the primitive Tibetan race extends into
Burma, where however it has become greatly modified and
again civilised under different climatic and
cultural influences. Thus we see how, in the
course of ages, the Bod-pa have widened their
domain, radiating in all directions from the
central cradle-land about the Upper Brahmaputra (San-po)
valley westwards into Kashmir, eastwards into China, southwards
down the Himalayan slopes to the Gangetic plains,
south-eastwards to Indo-China. In some places they have
come into contact with other races and disappeared either by
total extinction or by absorption (India, Hindu-Kush), or else
preserved their type while accepting the speech, religion, and
culture of later intruders. Such are the <i>Garhwali</i>, and many
groups in Nepal, especially the dominant <i>Gurkhas</i> (<i>Khas</i><a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>), of
whom there are twelve branches, all Aryanised and since the
twelfth century speaking the <i>Parbattia Bhasha</i>, a Prakrit or
vulgar Sanskrit tongue current amongst an extremely mixed
population of about 2,000,000.</p>

<p>In other directions the migrations took place in remote
prehistoric times, the primitive proto-Tibetan groups becoming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
more and more specialised as they receded farther and farther
from the cradle-land into Mongolia, Siberia, China, Farther
India, and Malaysia. This is at least how I understand the
peopling of a great part of the eastern hemisphere by an
original nucleus of Mongolic type first differentiated from
a pleistocene precursor on the Tibetan tableland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Temperament.</div>

<p>Strangely contradictory estimates have been formed of the
temperament and mental characters of the Bod-pa, some, such
as that of Turner<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>, no doubt too favourable,
while others err perhaps in the opposite direction.
Thus Desgodins, who nevertheless knew them well, describes
the cultured Tibetan of the south as "a slave towards the
great, a despot towards the weak, knavish or treacherous
according to circumstances, always on the look-out to defraud,
and lying impudently to attain his end," and much more to the
same effect<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>.</p>

<p>W. W. Rockhill, who is less severe, thinks that "the
Tibetan's character is not as black as Horace della Penna and
Desgodins have painted it. Intercourse with these people
extending over six years leads me to believe that the Tibetan
is kindhearted, affectionate, and law-abiding<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>." He concludes,
however, with a not very flattering native estimate deduced
from the curious national legend that "the earliest inhabitants
of Tibet descended from a king of monkeys and a female
hobgoblin, and the character of the race perhaps from those of
its first parents. From the king of monkeys [he was an
incarnate god] they have religious faith and kindheartedness,
intelligence and application, devotion to religion and to
religious debate; from the hobgoblin they get cruelty, fondness
for trade and money-making, great bodily strength,
lustfulness, fondness for gossip, and carnivorous instinct<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of
Lamaism on the
Tibetan
Character.</div>

<p>While they are cheerful under a depressing priestly regime,
all allow that they are vindictive, superstitious, and cringing in
the presence of the lamas, who are at heart more
dreaded than revered.  In fact the whole
religious world is one vast organised system
of hypocrisy, and above the old pagan beliefs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
common to all primitive peoples there is merely a veneer of
Buddhism, above which follows another and most pernicious
veneer of lamaism (priestcraft), under the yoke of which the
natural development of the people has been almost completely
arrested for several centuries. The burden is borne with
surprising endurance, and would be intolerable but for the
relief found in secret and occasionally even open revolt against
the more oppressive ordinances of the ecclesiastical rule.
Thus, despite the prescriptions regarding a strict vegetarian
diet expressed in the formula "eat animal flesh eat thy
brother," not only laymen but most of the lamas themselves
supplement their frugal diet of milk, butter, barley-meal, and
fruits with game, yak, and mutton&mdash;this last pronounced by
Turner the best in the world. The public conscience, however,
is saved by a few extra turns of the prayer-wheel at such
repasts, and by the general contempt in which is held the
hereditary caste of butchers, who like the Jews in medieval
times are still confined to a "ghetto" of their own in all the
large towns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Horsoks.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Tanguts.</div>

<p>These remarks apply more particularly to the settled
southern communities living in districts where a little agriculture
is possible. Elsewhere the religious cloak
is worn very loosely, and the nomad <i>Horsoks</i> of
the northern steppes, although all nominal Buddhists, pay but
scant respect to the decrees supposed to emanate from the
Dalai Lama enshrined in Lhasa. Horsok is an almost unique
ethnical term<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>, being a curious compound of the two names
applied by the Tibetans to the <i>Hor-pa</i> and the <i>Sok-pa</i> who
divide the steppe between them. The Hor-pa, who occupy the
western parts, are of Turki stock, and are the only group of that
race known to me who profess Buddhism<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>, all the rest being
Muhammadans with some Shamanists (Yakuts) in the Lena
basin. The Sok-pa, who roam the eastern plains and valleys,
although commonly called Mongols, are true Tibetans or
more strictly speaking Tanguts, of whom there are here two
branches, the <i>Goliki</i> and the <i>Yegrai</i>, all, like the Hor-pa, of
Tibetan speech. The Yegrai, as described by Prjevalsky,
closely resemble the other North Tibetan tribes,
with their long, matted locks falling on their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
shoulders, their scanty whiskers and beard, angular head,
dark complexion and dirty garb<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>.</p>

<p>Besides stock-breeding and predatory warfare, all these
groups follow the hunt, armed with darts, bows, and matchlock
guns; the musk-deer is ensnared, and the only animal
spared is the stag, "Buddha's horse." The taste of these
rude nomads for liquid blood is insatiable, and the surveyor,
Nain Singh, often saw them fall prone on the ground to lick
up the blood flowing from a wounded beast. As soon as
weaned, the very children and even the horses are fed on
a diet of cheese, butter, and blood, kneaded together in a
horrible mess, which is greedily devoured when the taste is
acquired. On the other hand alcoholic drinks are little
consumed, the national beverage being coarse Chinese tea
imported in the form of bricks and prepared with <i>tsampa</i>
(barley-meal) and butter, and thus becoming a food as well as
a drink. The lamas have a monopoly of this tea-trade, which
could not stand the competition of the Indian growers; hence
arises the chief objection to removing the barriers of seclusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tibetan
Polyandry.</div>

<p>Tibet is one of the few regions where polyandrous customs,
intimately associated with the matriarchal state, still persist
almost in their pristine vigour. The husbands
are usually but not necessarily all brothers,
and the bride is always obtained by purchase.
Unless otherwise arranged, the oldest husband is the putative
"father," all the others being considered as "uncles." An
inevitable result of the institution is to give woman a dominant
position in society; hence the "queens" of certain tribes,
referred to with so much astonishment by the early Chinese
chroniclers. Survivors of this "petticoat government" have
been noticed by travellers amongst the Lolos, Mossos, and
other indigenous communities about the Indo-Chinese frontiers.
But it does not follow that polyandry and a matriarchal state
always and necessarily preceded polygyny and a patriarchal
state. On the contrary, it would appear that polyandry never
could have been universal; possibly it arose from special
conditions in particular regions, where the struggle for existence
is severe, and the necessity of imposing limits to the
increase of population more urgent than elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>.  Hence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
to me it seems as great a mistake to assume a matriarchate as
it is to assume promiscuity as the universal antecedent of all
later family relations. In Tibet itself polygyny exists side
by side with polyandry amongst the wealthy classes, while
monogamy is the rule amongst the poor pastoral nomads of
the northern steppe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Burial
Customs.</div>

<p>Great ethnical importance has been attached by some
distinguished anthropologists to the treatment of the dead.
But, as in the New Stone and Metal Ages in
Europe cremation and burial were practised side
by side<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>, so in Tibet the dead are now simultaneously
disposed of in diverse ways. It is a question not
so much of race as of caste or social classes, or of the lama's
pleasure, who, when the head has been shaved to facilitate
the transmigration of the soul, may order the body to be
burnt, buried, cast into the river, or even thrown to carrion
birds or beasts of prey. Strange to say, the last method,
carried out with certain formalities, is one of the most honourable,
although the lamas are generally buried in a seated
posture, and high officials burnt, and (in Ladakh) the ashes,
mixed with a little clay, kneaded into much venerated effigies&mdash;doubtless
a survival of ancestry worship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bonbo
Religion.</div>

<p>Reference was above made to the primitive Shamanistic
ideas which still survive beneath the Buddhist and the later
lamaistic systems.  In the central and eastern provinces of
Ui and Tsang this pre-Buddhist religion has
again struggled to the surface, or rather persisted
under the name of <i>Bonbo</i> (<i>Boa-ho</i>) side by side
with the national creed, from which it has even borrowed
many of its present rites. From the colour of the robes
usually worn by its priests, it is known as the sect of the
"Blacks," in contradistinction to the orthodox "Yellow" and
dissenting "Red" lamaists, and as now constituted, its origin
is attributed to Shen-rab (Gsen-rabs), who flourished about
the fifth century before the new era, and is venerated as the
equal of Buddha himself. His followers, who were powerful
enough to drive Buddhism from Tibet in the tenth century,
worship 18 chief deities, the best known being the red and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
black demons, the snake devil, and especially the fiery
tiger-god, father of all the secondary members of this truly
"diabolical pantheon." It is curious to note that the sacred
symbol of the Bonbo sect is the ubiquitous svastika, only
with the hooks of the cross reversed,
<img src="images/cross1.png" width="65" height="30"  alt="Swastika 1" title="Swastika 1" />
instead of <img src="images/cross2.png" width="65" height="30"  alt="Swastika 2" title="Swastika 2" />.
This change, which appears to have escaped the diligent
research of Thomas Wilson<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>, was caused by the practice of
turning the prayer-wheel from right to left as the red lamas
do, instead of from left to right as is the orthodox way. The
common Buddhist formula of six syllables&mdash;<i>om-ma-ni-pad-me-hum</i>&mdash;is
also replaced by one of seven syllables&mdash;<i>ma-tri-mon-tre-sa-ta-dzun</i><a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buddhism
and Lamaism.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Buddhist
and Christian
Ritualism.</div>

<p>Buddhism itself, introduced by Hindu missionaries, is more
recent than is commonly supposed. Few conversions were
made before the fifth century of our era, and
the first temple dates only from the year 698.
Reference is often made to the points of contact
or "coincidences" which have been observed between this
system and that of the Oriental and Latin Christian Churches.
There is no question of a common dogma, and the numerous
resemblances are concerned only with ritualistic details, such
as the cross, the mitre, dalmatica, and other distinctive vestments,
choir singing, exorcisms, the thurible,
benedictions with outstretched hand, celibacy,
the rosary, fasts, processions, litanies, spiritual
retreats, holy water, scapulars or other charms, prayer
addressed to the saints, relics, pilgrimages, music and bells
at the service, monasticism; this last being developed to
a far greater extent in Tibet than at any time in any Christian
land, Egypt not excepted. The lamas, representing the
regular clergy of the Roman Church, hold a monopoly of all
"science," letters, and arts. The block printing-presses are
all kept in the huge monasteries which cover the land, and
from them are consequently issued only orthodox works and
treatises on magic.  Religion itself is little better than a
system of magic, and the sole aim of all worship, reduced to
a mere mechanical system of routine, is to baffle the machinations
of the demons who at every turn beset the path of
the wayfarer through this "vale of tears."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Prayer-Wheel.</div>

<p>For this purpose the prayer-wheels&mdash;an ingenious contrivance
by which innumerable supplications, not
less efficacious because vicarious, may be offered
up night and day to the powers of darkness&mdash;are
incessantly kept going all over the land, some being so
cleverly arranged that the sacred formula may be repeated as
many as 40,000 times at each revolution of the cylinder.
These machines, which have also been introduced into Korea
and Japan, have been at work for several centuries without
any appreciable results, although fitted up in all the houses,
by the river banks or on the hill-side, and kept in motion by
the hand, wind, and water; while others of huge size, 30 to
40 feet high and 15 to 20 in diameter, stand in the temples,
and at each turn repeat the contents of whole volumes of
liturgical essays stowed away in their capacious receptacles.
But despite all these everlasting revolutions, stagnation reigns
supreme throughout the most priest-ridden land under the sun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Language and
Letters.</div>

<p>With its religion Tibet imported also its letters from India
by the route of Nepal or Kashmir in the seventh
century. Since then the language has undergone
great changes, always, like other members
of the Indo-Chinese family, in the direction from agglutination
towards monosyllabism<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>. But the orthography, apart
from a few feeble efforts at reform, has remained stationary,
so that words are still written as they were pronounced
1200 years ago. The result is a far greater discrepancy
between the spoken and written tongue than in any other
language, English not excepted. Thus the province of Ui
has been identified by Sir A. Cunningham with Ptolemy's
<i>Debasae</i> through its written form <i>Dbus</i>, though now always
pronounced <i>U</i><a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>. This bears out de Lacouperie's view that all
words were really uttered as originally spelt, although often
beginning with as many as three consonants. Thus <i>spra</i>
(monkey) is now pronounced <i>deu</i> in the Lhasa dialect, but
still <i>streu-go</i> in that of the province of Kham. The phonetic
disintegration is still going on, so that, barring reform, the
time must come when there will be no correspondence at all
between sound and its graphic expression.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Diverse Linguistic
Types.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Lepcha.</div>

<p>On the other hand it is a mistake to suppose that all
languages in the Indo-Chinese linguistic zone have undergone
this enormous extent of phonetic decay. The
indefatigable B. H. Hodgson has made us acquainted
with several, especially in Nepal, which
are of a highly conservative character. Farther east the
<i>Lepcha</i> (properly <i>Rong</i>) of Sikkim presents the
remarkable peculiarity of distinct agglutination
of the Mongolo-Turki, or perhaps I should say of the Kuki-Lushai
type, combined with numerous homophones and a
total absence of tone. Thus <i>pano-sa</i>, of a king, <i>pano-sang</i>,
kings, and <i>pano-sang-sa</i>, of kings, shows pure agglutination,
while <i>m&aacute;t</i> yields no less than twenty-three distinct meanings<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>,
which should necessitate a series of discriminating tones, as
in Chinese or Siamese. Their absence, however, is readily
explained by the persistence of the agglutinative principle,
which renders them unnecessary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Angami-Naga
Speech.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Kuki-Lushai
Language.</div>

<p>A somewhat similar feature is presented by the Angami
Naga, the chief language of the Naga Hills, of which
R. B. McCabe writes that it is "still in a very
primitive stage of the agglutinating class," and
"peculiarly rich in intonation," although "for
one Naga who clearly marks these tonal distinctions twenty
fail to do so<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>." It follows that it is mainly spoken without
tones, and although said to be "distinctly monosyllabic" it
really abounds in polysyllables, such as <i>merenama</i>, orphan,
<i>kehutsaporimo</i>, nowhere, <i>dukriw&aacute;ch&eacute;</i>, to kill, etc. There are
also numerous verbal formative elements given by McCabe
himself, so that Angami must clearly be included in the
agglutinating order. To this order also belongs beyond all
doubt the <i>Kuki-Lushai</i> of the neighbouring
North Kachar Hills and parts of Nagaland itself,
the common speech in fact of the <i>Rangkhols</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
<i>Jansens</i>, <i>Lushai</i>, <i>Roeys</i> and other hill peoples, collectively
called <i>Kuki</i> by the lowlanders, and <i>Dzo</i> by themselves<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>.
The highly agglutinating character of this language is evident
from the numerous conjugations given by Soppitt<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>, for some
of which he has no names, but which may be called <i>Acceleratives</i>,
<i>Retardatives</i>, <i>Complementatives</i>, and so on. Thus with
the root, <i>ahong</i>, come, and infix <i>j&aacute;m</i>, slow, is formed the
retardative <i>n&aacute;ng ahongj&aacute;mrangmoh</i>, "will-you-come-slowly?"
(<i>rang</i>, future, <i>moh</i>, interrogative particle)<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Naga Tribes.</div>

<p>The Kuki, the Naga and the Manipuri, none of which
claim to be the original occupants of the country, have a
tradition of a common ancestor, who had three
sons who became the progenitors of the tribes.
The Kuki are found almost everywhere throughout Manipur.
"We are like the birds of the air," said a Kuki to T. C. Hodson,
"we make our nests here this year, and who knows where we
shall build next year<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>?" The following description is given of
the Naga tribes, <i>Tangkhuls</i>, <i>Mao</i> and <i>Maram Nagas</i> (<i>Angami
Nagas</i>), <i>Kolya</i>, or <i>Mayang Khong</i> group, <i>Kabuis</i>, <i>Quoirengs</i>,
<i>Chirus</i> and <i>Marrings</i>. "Differences of stature, dress,
coiffure and weapons make it easy to distinguish between the
members of these tribes. In colour they are all brown with
but little variety, though some of the Tangkhuls who earn
their living by salt making seem to be darker. Among them
all, as among the Manipuris, there are persons who have a
tinge of colour in their cheeks when still young. The nose
also varies, for there are cases where it is almost straight,
while in the majority of individuals it is flattened at the nostril.
Here and there one may see noses which in profile are almost
Roman. The eyes are usually brown, though black eyes are
sometimes found to occur. The jaw is generally clean, not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>heavy, and the hair is of some variety, as there are many
persons whose hair is decidedly curly, and in most there is a
wave. Beards are very uncommon, and hair on the face is
very rare, so much so that the few who possess a moustache
are known as <i>khoi-hao-bas</i> (Meithei words, meaning moustache
grower). I am informed that the ladies do not like hirsute
men, and that the men therefore pull out any stray hairs.
The cheekbones are often prominent and the slope of the eye
is not very marked<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>." The stature is moderate varying from
the slender lightly built Marrings to the tall sturdy finely
proportioned Maos. The women are all much shorter than
the men, but strongly built with a muscular development of
which the men would not be ashamed. The land is thickly
peopled with local deities and at Maram the case is recorded
of a Rain Deity who was once a man of the village specially
cunning in rain making. Among the points of special interest
in this region are the stone monuments still erected in honour
of the dead, and the custom of head-hunting, connected with
simple blood feud, with agrarian rites, with funerary rites and
eschatological belief, and in some cases no more than a social
duty<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The general
Ethnical Relations
in Indo-China.</div>

<p>Through these Naga and Kuki aborigines we pass without
any break of continuity from the Bhotiya populations of the
Himalayan slopes to those of Indo-China. Here
also, as indeed in nearly all semi-civilised lands,
peoples at various grades of culture are found
dwelling for ages side by side&mdash;rude and savage
groups on the uplands or in the more dense wooded tracts,
settled communities with a large measure of political unity (in
fact nations and peoples in the strict sense of those terms) on
the lowlands, and especially along the rich alluvial riverine
plains of this well watered region. The common theory is
that the wild tribes represent the true aborigines driven to the
hills and woodlands by civilised invaders from India and other
lands, who are now represented by the settled communities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aborigines
and Cultured
Peoples of one
Stock.</div>

<p>Whether such movements and dislocations have elsewhere
taken place we need not here stop to inquire; indeed their
probability, and in some instances their certainty may be frankly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>admitted. But I cannot think that the theory expresses the
true relations in most parts of Farther India. Here the
civilised peoples, and <i>ex hypothesi</i> the intruders,
are the Manipuri, Burmese, Arakanese, and the
nearly extinct or absorbed Talaings or Mons in
the west; the Siamese, Shans or Laos, and
Khamti in the centre; the Annamese (Tonkinese and Cochin-Chinese),
Cambojans, and the almost extinct Champas in the
east. Nearly all of these I hold to be quite as indigenous as
the hillmen, the only difference being that, thanks to their
more favourable environment, they emerged at an early date
from the savage state and thus became more receptive to
foreign civilising influences, mostly Hindu, but also Chinese
(in Annam). All are either partly or mainly of Mongolic or
Indonesian type, and all speak toned Indo-Chinese languages,
except the Cambojans and Champas, whose linguistic relations
are with the Oceanic peoples, who are not here in question.
The cultivated languages are no doubt full of Sanskrit or
Prakrit terms in the west and centre, and of Chinese in the
east, and all, except Annamese, which uses a Chinese ideographic
system, are written with alphabets derived through
the square Pali characters from the Devanagari. It is also
true that the vast monuments of Burma, Siam, and Camboja
all betray Hindu influences, many of the temples being covered
with Brahmanical or Buddhist sculptures and inscriptions. But
precisely analogous phenomena are reproduced in Java,
Sumatra, and other Malaysian lands, as well as in Japan and
partly in China itself. Are we then to conclude that there
have been Hindu invasions and settlements in all these regions,
the most populous on the globe?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Talaings.</div>

<p>During the historic period a few Hinduized Dravidians,
especially Telingas (Telugus) of the Coromandel coast, have
from time to time emigrated to Indo-China
(Pegu), where the name survives amongst the
"Talaings," that is, the Mons, by whom they
were absorbed, just as the Mons themselves are now being
absorbed by the Burmese.  Others of the same connection
have gained a footing here and there in Malaysia, especially
the Malacca coastlands, where they are called "Klings<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>,"
<i>i.e.</i> Telings, Telingas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>But beyond these partial movements, without any kind of
influence on the general ethnical relations, I know of no Hindu
(some have even used the term "Aryan," and have brought
Aryans to Camboja) invasions except those of a moral order&mdash;the
invasions of the zealous Hindu missionaries, both Brahman
and Buddhist, which, however, amply suffice to account for all
the above indicated points of contact between the Indian, the
Indo-Chinese, and the Malayan populations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Manipuri.</div>

<p>That the civilised lowlanders and rude highlanders are
generally of the same aboriginal stocks is well seen in the
Manipur district with its fertile alluvial plains and
encircling Naga and Lushai Hills on the north
and south. The Hinduized Manipuri of the plains, that is,
the politically dominant <i>Meithis</i>, as they call themselves, are
considered by George Watt to be "a mixed race between the
Kukies and the Nagas<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>." The Meithis are described as
possessing in general the facial characteristics of Mongolian
type, but with great diversity of feature. "It is not uncommon
to meet with girls with brownish-black hair, brown eyes, fair
complexions, straight noses and rosy cheeks<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>." In spite of
the veneer of civilisation acquired by the Meithis, the old order
of things has by no means passed away. "The <i>maiba</i>, the
doctor and priest of the animistic system, still finds a livelihood
despite the competition on the one hand of the Brahmin, and
on the other of the hospital Assistant. Nevertheless the
<i>maibas</i> frequently adapt their methods to the altered circumstances
in which they now find themselves, and realize that
the combination of croton oil and a charm is more efficacious
than the charm alone<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion.</div>

<p>"It is possible to discover at least four definite orders of
spiritual beings who have crystallized out from the amorphous
mass of animistic Deities. There are the <i>Lam
Lai</i>, gods of the country-side who shade off into
Nature Gods controlling the rain, the primal necessity of an
agricultural community; the <i>Umang Lai</i> or Deities of the
Forest Jungle; the <i>Imung Lai</i>, the Household Deities, Lords
of the lives, the births and the deaths of individuals, and there
are Tribal Ancestors, the ritual of whose worship is a strange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
compound of magic and Nature-worship. Beyond these
Divine beings, who possess in some sort a majesty of orderly
decent behaviour, there are spirits of the mountain passes,
spirits of the lakes and rivers, vampires and all the horrid
legion of witchcraft.... It is difficult to estimate the precise
effect of Hinduism on the civilisation of the people, for to the
outward observer they seem to have adopted only the festivals,
the outward ritual, the caste marks and the exclusiveness
of Hinduism, while all unmindful of its spirit and inward
essentials. Colonel McCulloch remarked nearly fifty years
ago that 'In fact their observances are only for appearance
sake, not the promptings of the heart<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>.'"</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Khel
System.</div>

<p>It is noteworthy that the Manipuri are also devoted to the
game of polo, which R. C. Temple tells us they play much in
the same way as do the Balti and Ladakhi at the opposite
extremity of the Himalayas. Another remarkable link with
the "Far West" is the term <i>Khel</i>, which has
travelled all the way from Persia or Parthia
through Afghanistan to Nagaland, where it
retains the same meaning of clan or section of a village, and
produces the same disintegrating effects as amongst the
Afghans. In Angamiland each village is split into two or
more Khels, and "it is no unusual state of affairs to find
Khel A of one village at war with Khel B of another, while
not at war with Khel B of its own village. The Khels are
often completely separated by great walls, the people on either
side living within a few yards of each other, yet having no
dealings whatever. Each Khel has its own headman, but
little respect is paid to the chief: each Khel maybe described
as a small republic<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>." There appears to be no trace even of
a <i>jirga</i>, or council of elders, by which some measure of cohesion
is imparted to the Afghan Khel system.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Chins.</div>

<p>From the Kuki-Nagas the transition is unbroken to the
large group of <i>Chins</i> of the Chindwin valley, named from them,
and thence northwards to the rude <i>Kakhyens</i>
(<i>Kachins</i>) about the Irawadi headstreams and
southwards to the numerous <i>Karen</i> tribes, who occupy the
ethnical parting-line between Burma and Siam all the way
down to Tenasserim.</p>

<p>For the first detailed account of the Chins we are indebted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
to S. Carey and H. N. Tuck<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>, who accept B. Houghton's
theory that these tribes, as well as the Kuki-Lushai, "originally
lived in what we now know as Tibet, and are of one and the
same stock; their form of government, method of cultivation,
manners and customs, beliefs and traditions, all point to one
origin." The term Chin, said to be a Burmese form of the
Chinese <i>jin</i>, "men," is unknown to these aborigines, who call
themselves <i>Yo</i> in the north and <i>Lai</i> in the south, while in
Lower Burma they are <i>Shu</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confused Tribal
Nomenclature.</div>

<p>In truth there is no recognised collective name, and <i>Shendu</i>
(<i>Sindhu</i>) often so applied is proper only to the once formidable
Chittagong and Arakan frontier tribes, <i>Klangklangs</i>
and <i>Hakas</i>, who with the <i>Sokt&eacute;</i>, <i>Tashons</i>,
<i>Siyirs</i>, and others are now reduced and administered
from Falam. Each little group has its own tribal
name, and often one or two others, descriptive, abusive and so
on, given them by their neighbours. Thus the <i>Nwengals</i>
(<i>Nun</i>, river, <i>ngal</i>, across) are only that section of the Sokt&eacute;s
now settled on the farther or right bank of the Manipur, while
the Sokt&eacute;s themselves (<i>Sok</i>, to go down, <i>t&eacute;</i>, men) are so called
because they migrated from Chin Nwe (9 miles from Tiddim),
cradle of the Chin race, down to Molbem, their earliest
settlement, which is the Mobingyi of the Burmese. So with
Siyin, the Burmese form of <i>Sheyant&eacute;</i> (<i>she</i>, alkali, <i>yan</i>, side, <i>t&eacute;</i>,
men), the group who settled by the alkali springs east of Chin
Nwe, who are the <i>Taut&eacute;</i> ("stout" or "sturdy" people) of the
Lushai and southern Chins. Let these few specimens suffice
as a slight object-lesson in the involved tribal nomenclature
which prevails, not only amongst the Chins, but everywhere
in the Tibeto-Indo-Chinese domain, from the north-western
Himalayas to Cape St James at the south-eastern extremity
of Farther India. I have myself collected nearly a thousand
such names of clans, septs, and fragmentary groups within
this domain, and am well aware that the list neither is, nor
ever can be, complete, the groups themselves often being
unstable quantities in a constant state of fluctuation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Creation
Legends.</div>

<p>Most of the Chin groups have popular legends to explain
either their origin or their present reduced state. Thus the
Tawyans, a branch of the Tashons, claim to be Torrs, that
is, the people of the Rawvan district, who were formerly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>very powerful, but were ruined by their insane efforts to
capture the sun. Building a sort of Jacob's
ladder, they mounted higher and higher; but
growing tired, quarrelled among themselves, and
one day, while half of them were clambering up the pole, the
other half below cut it down just as they were about to seize
the sun. So the Whenohs, another Tashon group, said to be
Lushais left behind in a district now forming part of Chinland,
tell a different tale. They say they came out of the rocks at
Sepi, which they think was their original home. They share,
however, this legend of their underground origin with the
Sokt&eacute;s and several other Chin tribes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mental and
Physical Qualities.</div>

<p>Amid much diversity of speech and physique the Chins
present some common mental qualities, such as "slow speech,
serious manner, respect for birth and knowledge
of pedigrees, the duty of revenge, the taste for
a treacherous method of warfare, the curse of
drink, the virtue of hospitality, the clannish feeling, the vice
of avarice, the filthy state of the body, mutual distrust, impatience
under control, the want of power of combination and of
continued effort, arrogance in victory, speedy discouragement
and panic in defeat<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>."</p>

<p>Physically they are a fine race, taller and stouter than the
surrounding lowlanders, men 5 feet 10 or 11 inches being
common enough among the independent southerners. There
are some "perfectly proportioned giants with a magnificent
development of muscle." Yet dwarfs are met with in some
districts, and in others "the inhabitants are a wretched lot,
much afflicted with go&icirc;tre, amongst whom may be seen cretins
who crawl about on all fours with the pigs in the gutter. At
Dimlo, in the Sokt&eacute; tract, leprosy has a firm hold on the
inhabitants."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods, Nats, and
the After-Life.</div>

<p>Although often described as devil-worshippers, the Chins
really worship neither god nor devil. The northerners believe
there is no Supreme Being, and although the
southerners admit a "Kozin" or head god, to
whom they sacrifice, they do not worship him,
and never look to him for any grace or mercy, except that of
withholding the plagues and misfortunes which he is capable
of working on any in this world who offend him. Besides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Kozin, there are <i>nats</i> or spirits of the house, family, clan,
fields; and others who dwell in particular places in the air,
the streams, the jungle, and the hills. Kindly <i>nats</i> are
ignored; all others can and will do harm unless propitiated<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>.</p>

<p>The departed go to <i>Mithikwa</i>, "Dead Man's Village,"
which is divided into <i>Pwethikwa</i>, the pleasant abode, and
<i>Sathikwa</i>, the wretched abode of the <i>unavenged</i>. Good or
bad deeds do not affect the future of man, who must go
to Pwethikwa if he dies a natural or accidental death,
and to Sathikwa if killed, and there bide till avenged
by blood. Thus the vendetta receives a sort of religious
sanction, strengthened by the belief that the slain becomes
the slave of the slayer in the next world. "Should the
slayer himself be slain, then the first slain is the slave of the
second slain, who in turn is the slave of the man who killed
him."</p>

<p>Whether a man has been honest or dishonest in this
world is of no consequence in the next existence; but, if he
has killed many people in this world, he has many slaves to
serve him in his future existence; if he has killed many wild
animals, then he will start well-supplied with food, for all that
he kills on earth are his in the future existence. In the next
existence hunting and drinking will certainly be practised,
but whether fighting and raiding will be indulged in is
unknown.</p>

<p>Cholera and small-pox are spirits, and when cholera broke
out among the Chins who visited Rangoon in 1895 they
carried their <i>dahs</i> (knives) drawn to scare off the <i>nat</i>, and
spent the day hiding under bushes, so that the spirit should
not find them. Some even wanted to sacrifice a slave boy,
but were talked over to substitute some pariah dogs. They
firmly believe in the evil eye, and the Hakas think the Sujins
and others are all wizards, whose single glance can bewitch
them, and may cause lizards to enter the body and devour
the entrails. A Chin once complained to Surgeon-Major
Newland that a <i>nat</i> had entered his stomach at the glance of
a Yahow, and he went to hospital quite prepared to die. But
an emetic brought him round, and he went off happy in the
belief that he had vomited the <i>nat</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Kakhyens.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Caucasic
Elements.</div>

<p>Ethnically connected with the Kuki-Naga groups are the
<i>Kakhyens</i> of the Irawadi headstreams, and the <i>Karens</i>, who
form numerous village communities about the
Burma-Siamese borderland. The Kakhyens,
so called abusively by the Burmese, are the <i>Cacobees</i> of the
early writers<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>, whose proper name is <i>Singpho</i> (<i>Chingpaw</i>), i.e.
"Men<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>," and whose curious semi-agglutinating speech, spoken
in an ascending tone, each sentence ending in a long-drawn <i>&icirc;</i>
in a higher key (Bigandet), shows affinities rather with the
Mishmi and other North Assamese tongues than with the
cultured Burmese. They form a very widespread family,
stretching from the Eastern Himalayas right into Yunnan,
and presenting two somewhat marked physical types: (1) the
true Chingpaws, with short round head, low
forehead, prominent cheek-bones, slant eye,
broad nose, thick protruding lips, very dark
brown hair and eyes, dirty buff colour, mean height (about
5 ft. 5 or 6 in.) with disproportionately short legs; (2) a much
finer race, with regular Caucasic features, long oval face,
pointed chin, aquiline nose. One Kakhyen belle met with at
Bhamo, "with large lustrous eyes and fair skin, might almost
have passed for a European<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>."</p>

<p>It is important to note this Caucasic element, which we
first meet here going eastwards from the Himalayas, but
which is found either separate or interspersed amongst the
Mongoloid populations all over the south-east Asiatic uplands
from Tibet to Cochin-China, and passing thence into
Oceanica<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Karens</div>

<p>The kinship of the Kakhyens with the still more
numerous Karens is now generally accepted, and it is no
longer found necessary to bring the latter all
the way from Turkestan. They form a large
section, perhaps one-sixth, of the whole population of Burma,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
and overflow into the west Siamese borderlands. Their subdivisions
are endless, though all may be reduced to three
main branches, <i>Sgaws</i>, <i>Pwos</i> and <i>Bwais</i>, these last including
the somewhat distinct group of <i>Karenni</i>, or "Red Karens."
Although D. M. Smeaton calls the language "monosyllabic,"
it is evidently agglutinating, of the normal sub-Himalayan
type<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>.</p>

<p>The Karens are a short, sturdy race, with straight black

Christian Missions.</div>

<p>Despite the favourable pictures of the missionaries, whose
propaganda has been singularly successful amongst these
aborigines, the Karens are not an amiable or
particularly friendly people, but rather shy,
reticent and even surly, though trustworthy and loyal to those
chiefs and guides who have once gained their confidence. In
warfare they are treacherous rather than brave, and strangely
cruel even to little children. Their belief in a divine Creator
who has deserted them resembles that of the Kuki people,
and to the <i>nats</i> of the Kuki correspond the <i>la</i> of the Karens,
who are even more numerous, every mountain, stream, rapid,
crest, peak or other conspicuous object having its proper
indwelling <i>la</i>. There are also seven specially baneful spirits,
who have to be appeased by family offerings.
"On the whole their belief in a personal god,
their tradition as to the former possession of a
'law,' and their expectation of a prophet have made them
susceptible to Christianity to a degree that is almost unique.
Of this splendid opportunity the American mission has taken
full advantage, educating, civilising, welding together, and
making a people out of the downtrodden Karen tribes, while
Christianizing them<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Burmese.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Perplexing
Tribal Nomenclature.</div>

<p>In the Burmese division proper are comprised several
groups, presenting all grades of culture, from the sheer
savagery of the Mros, Kheongs, and others of
the Arakan Yoma range, and the agricultural
Mugs of the Arakan plains, to the dominant historical
Burmese nation of the Irawadi valley. Here also the terminology
is perplexing, and it may be well to explain that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span><i>Yoma</i>, applied by Logan collectively to all the Arakan Hill
tribes, has no ethnic value at all, simply meaning
a mountain range in Burmese<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>. <i>Toung-gnu</i>,
one of Mason's divisions of the Burmese family,
was merely a petty state founded by a younger branch of the
Royal House, and "has no more claim to rank as a separate
tribe than any other Burman town<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>. "<i>Tavoyers</i> are merely
the people of the Tavoy district, Tenasserim, originally from
Arakan, and now speaking a Burmese dialect largely affected
by Siamese elements; <i>Tungthas</i>, like Yoma, means "Highlander,"
and is even of wider application; the Tipperahs,
Mrungs, Kumi, Mros, Khemis, and Khyengs are all Tungthas
of Burmese stock, and speak rude Burmese dialects.</p>

<p>The correlative of Tungthas is <i>Khyungthas</i>, "River
People," that is, the Arakan Lowlanders comprising the
more civilised peoples about the middle and lower course of
the rivers, who are improperly called <i>Mugs</i> (<i>Maghs</i>) by the
Bengali, and whose real name is <i>Rakhaingtha</i>, <i>i.e.</i> people of
Rakhaing (Arakan). They are undoubtedly of the same
stock as the cultured Burmese, whose traditions point to
Arakan as the cradle of the race, and in whose chronicles the
Rakhaingtha are called <i>M'ranm&aacute;kr&iacute;h</i>, "Great M'ranmas," or
"Elder Burmese." Both branches call themselves <i>M'ranma,
M'rama</i> (the correct form of <i>Barma, Burma</i>, but now usually
pronounced Myamma), probably from a root <i>mro, myo</i>, "man,"
though connected by Burnouf with Brahma, the Brahmanical
having preceded the Buddhist religion in this region. In any
case the M'rama may claim a respectable antiquity, being
already mentioned in the national records so early as the first
century of the new era, when the land "was said to be overrun
with fabulous monsters and other terrors, which are called to
this day by the superstitious natives, the five enemies. These
were a fierce tiger, an enormous boar, a flying dragon, a
prodigious man-eating bird, and a huge creeping pumpkin,
which threatened to entangle the whole country<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Type.</div>

<p>The Burmese type has been not incorrectly described as
intermediate between the Chinese and the Malay, more
refined, or at least softer than either, of yellowish
brown or olive complexion, often showing very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">Character.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Burmese
Buddhism.</div>

<p>Most Europeans speak well of the Burmese people, whose
bright genial temperament and extreme friendliness towards
strangers more than outweigh a natural indolence
which hurts nobody but themselves, and a little
arrogance or vanity inspired by the still remembered glories
of a nation that once ruled over a great part of Indo-China.
Perhaps the most remarkable feature of Burmese society is
the almost democratic independence and equality of all classes
developed under an exceptionally severe Asiatic autocracy.
"They are perfectly republican in the freedom with which all
ranks mingle together and talk with one another, without any
marked distinction in regard to difference of rank or wealth<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>."
Scott attributes this trait, I think rightly, to the
great leveller, Buddhism, the true spirit of
which has perhaps been better preserved in
Burma than in any other land.</p>

<p>The priesthood has not become the privileged and
oppressive class that has usurped all spiritual and temporal
functions in Tibet, for in Burma everybody is or has been a
priest for some period of his life. All enter the monasteries&mdash;which
are the national schools&mdash;not only for general instruction,
but actually as members of the sacerdotal order. They
submit to the tonsure, take "minor orders," so to say, and
wear the yellow robe, if only for a few months or weeks or
days. But for the time being they must renounce "the world,
the flesh and the devil," and must play the mendicant, make
the round of the village at least once with the begging-bowl
hung round their neck in company with the regular members
of the community. They thus become initiated, and it
becomes no longer possible for the confraternity to impose
either on the rulers or on the ruled. "Teaching is all that
the brethren of the order do for the people. They have no
spiritual powers whatever. They simply become members of
a holy society that they may observe the precepts of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
Master more perfectly, and all they do for the alms lavished
on them by the pious laity is to instruct the children in reading,
writing, and the rudiments of religion<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>."</p>

<p>R. Grant Brown denies the common report which "has
appeared in almost every work in which religion in Burma
is dealt with" that Burman Buddhism is superficial. "The
Burman Buddhist is at least as much influenced by his
religion as the average Christian. The monks are probably
as strict in their religious observances as any large religious
body in the world.... Most laymen, too, obey the prohibitions
against alcohol and the taking of life, though these run
counter both to strong human instincts and to animistic
practice<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position of
Woman.</div>

<p>Nor is the personal freedom here spoken of confined to
the men. In no other part of the world do the women enjoy
a larger measure of independent action than in
Burma, with the result that they are acknowledged
to be far more virtuous, thrifty, and
intelligent than those of all the surrounding lands. Their
capacity for business and petty dealings is rivalled only by
their Gallic sisters; and H. S. Hallett tells us that in every
town and village "you will see damsels squatted on the floor
of the verandah with diminutive, or sometimes large, stalls
in front of them, covered with vegetables, fruit, betel-nut,
cigars and other articles. However numerous they may be,
the price of everything is known to them; and such is their
idea of probity, that pilfering is quite unknown amongst
them. They are entirely trusted by their parents from their
earliest years; even when they blossom into young women,
<i>chaperons</i> are never a necessity; yet immorality is far less
customary amongst them, I am led to believe, than in any
country in Europe<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>."</p>

<p>This observer quotes Bishop Bigandet, a forty years'
resident amongst the natives, to the effect that "in Burmah
and Siam the doctrines of Buddhism have produced a striking,
and to the lover of true civilization a most interesting result&mdash;the
almost complete equality of the condition of the women
with that of the men.  In these countries women are seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
circulating freely in the streets; they preside at the <i>comptoir</i>,
and hold an almost exclusive possession of the bazaars.
Their social position is more elevated, in every respect, than
in the regions where Buddhism is not the predominating
creed. They may be said to be men's companions, and not
their slaves."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tattooing.</div>

<p>Burma is one of those regions where tattooing has
acquired the rank of a fine art. Indeed the intricate designs
and general pictorial effect produced by the
Burmese artists on the living body are rivalled
only by those of Japan, New Zealand, and some other
Polynesian groups. Hallett, who states that "the Burmese,
the Shans, and certain Burmanized tribes are the only
peoples in the south of Asia who are known to tattoo their
body," tells us that the elaborate operation is performed only
on the male sex, the whole person from waist to knees, and
amongst some Shan tribes from neck to foot, being covered
with heraldic figures of animals, with intervening traceries, so
that at a little distance the effect is that of a pair of dark-blue
breeches<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>. The pigments are lamp-black or vermilion,
and the pattern is usually first traced with a fine hair pencil
and then worked in by a series of punctures made by a long
pointed brass style<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Tai-Shan
Peoples.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Ahom,
Khamti, and
Chinese
Shans.</div>

<p>East of Burma we enter the country of the <i>Shans</i>, one of
the most numerous and widespread peoples of Asia, who call
themselves <i>Tai</i> (<i>T'hai</i>), "Noble" or "Free,"
although slavery in various forms has from time
immemorial been a social institution amongst all
the southern groups. Here again tribal and national terminology
is somewhat bewildering; but it will help to notice
that <i>Shan</i>, said to be of Chinese origin<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>, is the collective
Burmese name, and therefore corresponds to <i>Lao</i>, the collective
Siamese name. These two terms are therefore rather
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>political than ethnical, Shan denoting all the Tai peoples
formerly subject to Burma and now mostly British subjects,
Lao all the Tai peoples formerly subject to Siam, and now
(since 1896) mostly French subjects<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>. The Siamese group
them all in two divisions, the <i>Lau-pang-dun</i>, "Black-paunch
Lao," so called because they clothe themselves as it were in
a dark skin-tight garb by the tattooing process; and the
<i>Lau-pang-kah</i>, "White-paunch Lao," who do not tattoo.
The Burmese groups call themselves collectively <i>Ngiou</i><a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>,
while the most general Chinese name is <i>Pa&iuml;</i> (<i>Pa-y</i>). Prince
Henri d'Orl&eacute;ans, who is careful to point out that Pa&iuml; is only
another name for Lao<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>, constantly met Pa&iuml; groups all along
the route from Tonking to Assam, and the bulk of the
lowland population in Assam itself belongs originally<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> to the
same family, though now mostly assimilated to the Hindus
in speech, religion, and general culture. Assam in fact takes
its name from the <i>Ahoms</i>, the "peerless," the
title first adopted by the Mau Shan chief,
Chukupha, who invaded the country from north-east
Burma, and in 1228 <small>A.D.</small> founded the Ahom
dynasty, which was overthrown in 1810 by the Burmese, who
were ejected in 1827 by the English<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>.</p>

<p>These Ahoms came from the Khamti (Kampti) district<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
about the sources of the Irawadi, where Prince Henri was
surprised to find a civilised and lettered Buddhist people of
Pa&iuml; (Shan) speech still enjoying political autonomy in the
dangerous proximity of <i>le l&eacute;opard britannique</i>. They call
themselves <i>Padao</i>, and it is curious to note that both <i>Padam</i>
and <i>Assami</i> are also tribal names amongst the neighbouring
Abor Hillmen. The French traveller was told that the
Padao, who claimed to be <i>T'hais</i> (Tai) like the Laotians<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>,
were indigenous, and he describes the type as also Laotian&mdash;straight
eyes rather wide apart, nose broad at base, forehead
arched, superciliary arches prominent, thick lips, pointed chin,
olive colour, slightly bronzed and darker than in the Lao
country; the men ill-favoured, the young women with pleasant
features, and some with very beautiful eyes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shan Cradle-land
and
Origins.</div>

<p>Passing into China we are still in the midst of Shan
peoples, whose range appears formerly to have extended up
to the right bank of the Yang-tse-Kiang, and
whose cradle has been traced by de Lacouperie
to "the Kiu-lung mountains north of Sechuen
and south of Shensi in China proper<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>." This authority holds
that they constitute a chief element in the Chinese race itself,
which, as it spread southwards beyond the Yang-tse-Kiang,
amalgamated with the Shan aborigines, and thus became
profoundly modified both in type and speech, the present
Chinese language comprising over thirty per cent. of Shan
ingredients. Colquhoun also, during his explorations in the
southern provinces, found that "most of the aborigines,
although known to the Chinese by various nicknames, were
Shans; and that their propinquity to the Chinese was slowly
changing their habits, manners, and dress, and gradually
incorporating them with that people<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shan and
Caucasic
Contacts.</div>

<p>This process of fusion has been in progress for ages, not
only between the southern Chinese and the Shans, but also
between the Shans and the Caucasic aborigines,
whom we first met amongst the Kakhyens, but
who are found scattered mostly in small groups
over all the uplands between Tibet and the Cochin-Chinese
coast range. The result is that the Shans are generally of
finer physique than either the kindred Siamese and Malays<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
in the south, or the more remotely connected Chinese in the
north. The colour, says Bock, "is much lighter than that
of the Siamese," and "in facial expression the Laotians are
better-looking than the Malays, having good high foreheads,
and the men particularly having regular well-shaped noses,
with nostrils not so wide as those of their neighbours<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>." Still
more emphatic is the testimony of Kreitner of the Szechenyi
expedition, who tells us that the Burmese Shans have "a
nobler head than the Chinese; the dark eyes are about
horizontal, the nose is straight, the whole expression approaches
that of the Caucasic race<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tai-Shan
Toned Speech.</div>

<p>Notwithstanding their wide diffusion, interminglings with
other races, varied grades of culture, and lack of political
cohesion, the Tai-Shan groups acquire a certain
ethnical and even national unity from their
generally uniform type, social usages, Buddhist
religion, and common Indo-Chinese speech. Amidst a chaos
of radically distinct idioms current amongst the surrounding
indigenous populations, they have everywhere preserved a
remarkable degree of linguistic uniformity, all speaking
various more or less divergent dialects of the same mother-tongue.
Excluding a large percentage of Sanskrit terms introduced
into the literary language by their Hindu educators,
this radical mother-tongue comprises about 1860 distinct
words or rather sounds, which have been reduced by phonetic
decay to so many monosyllables, each uttered with five tones,
the natural tone, two higher tones, and two lower<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>. Each
term thus acquires five distinct meanings, and in fact
represents five different words, which were phonetically
distinct dissyllables, or even polysyllables in the primitive
language.</p>

<p>The same process of disintegration has been at work
throughout the whole of the Indo-Chinese linguistic area,
where all the leading tongues&mdash;Chinese, Annamese, Tai-Shan,
Burmese&mdash;belong to the same isolating form of speech,
which, as explained in <i>Ethnology</i>, Chap. IX., is not a primitive
condition, but a later development, the outcome of profound
phonetic corruption.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Shan and other
Indo-Chinese
Writing
Systems.</div>

<p>The remarkable uniformity of the Tai-Shan member of
this order of speech may be in part due to the conservative
effects of the literary standard.  Probably over
2000 years ago most of the Shan groups were
brought under Hindu influences by the Brahman,
and later by the Buddhist missionaries,
who reduced their rude speech to written form, while introducing
a large number of Sanskrit terms inseparable from
the new religious ideas. The writing systems, all based on
the square Pali form of the Devanagari syllabic characters,
were adapted to the phonetic requirements of the various
dialects, with the result that the Tai-Shan linguistic family
is encumbered with four different scripts.  "The Western
Shans use one very like the Burmese; the Siamese have
a character of their own, which is very like Pali; the Shans
called L&uuml; have another character of their own; and to the
north of Siam the Lao Shans have another<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>."</p>

<p>These Shan alphabets of Hindu origin are supposed by
de Lacouperie to be connected with the writing systems which
have been credited to the Mossos, Lolos, and some other hill
peoples about the Chinese and Indo-Chinese borderlands.
At Lan-Chu in the Lolo country Prince Henri found that
MSS. were very numerous, and he was shown some very fine
specimens "enlumin&eacute;s." Here, he tells us, the script is still
in use, being employed jointly with Chinese in drawing up
legal documents connected with property. He was informed
that this Lolo script comprised 300 characters, read from top
to bottom and from left to right<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>, although other authorities
say from right to left.</p>

<p>Of the Lolo he gives no specimens<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>, but reproduces two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
or three pages of a Mosso book with transliteration and
translation. Other specimens, but without explanation, were
already known through Gill and Desgodins, and their
decipherment had exercised the ingenuity of several Chinese
scholars. Their failure to interpret them is now accounted
for by Prince Henri, who declares that, "strictly speaking
the Mossos have no writing system. The magicians keep
and still make copy-books full of hieroglyphics; each page
is divided into little sections (<i>cahiers</i>) following horizontally
from left to right, in which are inscribed one or more somewhat
rough figures, heads of animals, men, houses, conventional
signs representing the sky or lightning, and so on."
Some of the magicians expounded two of the books, which
contained invocations, beginning with the creation of the
world, and winding up with a catalogue of all the evils
threatening mortals, but to be averted by being pious, that
is, by making gifts to the magicians. The same ideas are
always expressed by the same signs; yet the magicians
declared that there was no alphabet, the hieroglyphs being
handed down bodily from one expert to another. Nevertheless
Prince Henri looks on this as one of the first steps
in the history of writing; "originally many of the Chinese
characters were simply pictorial, and if the Mossos, instead
of being hemmed in, had acquired a large expansion, their
sacred books might also perhaps have given birth to true
characters<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Mosso Origins.</b></div>

<p>Although now "hemmed in," the Mossos are a historical
and somewhat cultured people, belonging to the same group
as the <i>Iungs</i> (<i>Njungs</i>), who came from the
regions north-east of Tibet, and appeared on
the Chinese frontiers about 600 <small>B.C.</small> They are referred to
in the Chinese records of 796 <small>A.D.</small>, when they were reduced
by the king of Nanchao. After various vicissitudes they
recognised the Chinese suzerainty in the fourteenth century,
and were finally subdued in the eighteenth. De Lacouperie<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>
thinks they are probably of the same origin as the Lolos, the
two languages having much in common, and the names of
both being Chinese, while the Lolos and the Mossos call
themselves respectively <i>Nossu</i> (<i>Nesu</i>) and <i>Nashi</i> (<i>Nashri</i>).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Aborigines of
South China
and Annam.</div>

<p>Everywhere amongst these border tribes are met groups
of aborigines, who present more or less regular features
which are described by various travellers as
"Caucasic" or "European." Thus the <i>Kiu-tse</i>,
who are the <i>Khanungs</i> of the English maps,
and are akin to the large <i>Lu-tse</i> family (<i>Melam</i>, <i>Anu</i>, <i>Diasu</i>,
etc.), reminded Prince Henri of some Europeans of his
acquaintance<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>, and he speaks of the light colour, straight
nose and eyes, and generally fine type of the Yayo (Yao),
as the Chinese call them, but whose real name is <i>Lin-tin-yu</i>.</p>

<p>The same Caucasic element reappears in a pronounced
form amongst the indigenous populations of Tonking, to
whom A. Billet has devoted an instructive monograph<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>. This
observer, who declares that these aborigines are quite distinct
both from the Chinese and the Annamese, groups them in
three main divisions&mdash;<i>Tho</i>, <i>Nong</i>, and <i>Man</i><a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>&mdash;all collectively
called <i>Moi</i>, <i>Muong</i>, and <i>Myong</i> by the Annamese. The
Thos, who are the most numerous, are agriculturists, holding
all the upland valleys and thinning off towards the wooded
heights. They are tall compared to the Mongols (5 ft. 6
or 7 in.), lighter than the Annamese, round-headed, with oval
face, deep-set straight eyes, low cheek-bones, straight and
even slightly aquiline nose not depressed at root, and muscular
frames. They are a patient, industrious, and frugal people,
now mainly subject to Chinese and Annamese influences in
their social usages and religion. Very peculiar nevertheless
are some of their surviving customs, such as the feast of
youth, the pastime of swinging, and especially chess played
with living pieces, whose movements are directed by two
players. The language appears to be a Shan dialect, and
to this family the writer affiliates both the Thos and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Nongs. The latter are a much more mixed people, now
largely assimilated to the Chinese, although the primitive
type still persists, especially amongst the women, as is so
often the case. A. Billet tells us that he often met Nong
women "with light and sometimes even red hair<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Man-tse
Origins and
Affinities.</div>

<p>It is extremely interesting to learn that the Mans came
traditionally "from a far-off western land where their forefathers
were said to have lived in contact with
peoples of white blood thousands of years ago."
This tradition, which would identify them with
the above-mentioned Man-tse, is supported by their physical
appearance&mdash;long head, oval face, small cheek-bones, eyes
without the Mongol fold, skin not yellowish but rather
"browned by the sun," regular features&mdash;in nothing recalling
the traits of the yellow races.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Caucasic
Aborigines in
South-East
Asia.</div>

<p>Let us now turn to M. R. Verneau's comments on the
rich materials brought together by A. Billet,
in whom, "being not only a medical man,
but also a graduate in the natural sciences,
absolute confidence may be placed<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>."</p>

<p>"The M&aacute;ns-Tien, the M&aacute;ns-Coc, the M&aacute;ns-Meo (Miao,
Miao-tse, or Mieu) present a pretty complete identity with
the Pan-y and the Pan-yao of South Kwang-si; they are the
debris of a very ancient race, which with T. de Lacouperie
may be called pre-Chinese. This early race, which bore the
name of <i>Pan-hu</i> or <i>Ngao</i>, occupied Central China before the
arrival of the Chinese. According to M. d'Hervey de Saint-Denys,
the mountains and valleys of Kwei-ch&aacute;u where these
Miao-tse still survive were the cradle of the Pan-hu. In any
case it seems certain that the T'hai and the Man race came
from Central Asia, and that, from the anthropological standpoint,
they differ altogether from the Mongol group represented
by the Chinese and the Annamese. The Man
especially presents striking affinities with the Aryan type."</p>

<p>Thus is again confirmed by the latest investigations, and
by the conclusions of some of the leading members of the
French school of anthropology, the view first advanced by me
in 1879, that peoples of the Caucasic (here called "Aryan")
division had already spread to the utmost confines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
of south-east Asia in remote prehistoric times, and had
in this region even preceded the first waves of Mongolic
migration radiating from their cradle-land on the Tibetan
plateau<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Siamese
Shans.</div>

<p>Reference was above made to the singular lack of political
cohesion at all times betrayed by the Tai-Shan peoples.
The only noteworthy exception is the Siamese
branch, which forms the bulk of the population
in the Menam basin.  In this highly favoured
region of vast hill-encircled alluvial plains of inexhaustible
fertility, traversed by numerous streams navigable for light
craft, and giving direct access to the inland waters of
Malaysia, the Southern Shans were able at an early date to
merge the primitive tribal groups in a great nationality, and
found a powerful empire, which at one time dominated most
of Indo-China and the Malay Peninsula.</p>

<p>Siam, alone of all the Shan states, even still maintains
a precarious independence, although now again reduced by
European aggression to little more than the natural limits of
the fluvial valley, which is usually regarded by the Southern
Shans as the home of their race. Yet they appear to have
been here preceded by the Caucasic Khmers (Cambojans),
whose advent is referred in the national chronicles to the
year 543 <small>B.C.</small> and who, according to the Hindu records, were
expelled about 443 <small>A.D.</small> It was through these Khmers, and
not directly from India, that the "Sayamas" received their
Hindu culture, and the Siamese annals, mingling fact with
fiction, refer to the miraculous birth of the national hero,
Phra-Ruang, who threw off the foreign yoke, declared the
people henceforth T'hai, "Freemen," invented the present
Siamese alphabet, and ordered the Khom (Cambojan) to be
reserved in future for copying the sacred writings.</p>

<p>The introduction of Buddhism is assigned to the year
638 <small>A.D.</small>, one of the first authentic dates in the native records.
The ancient city of Labong had already been founded (575),
and other settlements now followed rapidly, always in the
direction of the south, according as the Shan race steadily
advanced towards the seaboard, driving before them or
mingling with Khmers, Lawas, Karens, and other aborigines,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
some now extinct, some still surviving on the wooded uplands
and plateaux encircling the Menam valley. Ayuthia, the
great centre of national life in later times, dates only from the
year 1350, when the empire had received its greatest expansion,
comprising the whole of Camboja, Pegu, Tenasserim,
and the Malay Peninsula, and extending its conquering arms
across the inland waters as far as Java<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>. Then followed the
disastrous wars with Burma, which twice captured and finally
destroyed Ayuthia (1767), now a picturesque elephant-park
visited by tourists from the present capital, Bangkok, founded
in 1772 a little lower down the Menam.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Siamese Social
System.</div>

<p>But the elements of decay existed from the first in the
institution of slavery or serfdom, which was not restricted to
a particular class, as in other lands, but, before
the modern reforms, extended in principle to
all the kings' subjects in mockery declared
"Freemen" by the founders of the monarchy. This, however,
may be regarded as perhaps little more than a legal fiction,
for at all times class distinctions were really recognised,
comprising the members of the royal family&mdash;a somewhat
numerous group&mdash;the nobles named by the king, the <i>leks</i> or
vassals, and the people, these latter being again subdivided
into three sections, those liable to taxation, those subject to
forced labour, and the slaves proper. But so little developed
was the sentiment of personal dignity and freedom, that
anybody from the highest noble to the humblest citizen might
at any moment lapse into the lowest category. Like most
Mongoloid peoples, the Siamese are incurable gamblers, and
formerly it was an everyday occurrence for a freeman to stake
all his goods and chattels, wives, children, and self, on the
hazard of the die.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Status of
Woman.</div>

<p>Yet the women, like their Burmese sisters, have always
held a somewhat honourable social position, being free to
walk abroad, go shopping, visit their friends,
see the sights, and take part in the frequent
public feastings without restriction.  Those,
however, who brought no dower and had to be purchased,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
might again be sold at any time, and many thus constantly
fell from the dignity of matrons to the position of the merest
drudges without rights or privileges of any kind. These
strange relations were endurable, thanks to the genial nature
of the national temperament, by which the hard lot of the
thralls was softened, and a little light allowed to penetrate
into the darkest corners<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> of the social system. The open slave-markets,
which in the vassal Lao states fostered systematic
raiding-expeditions amongst the unreduced aborigines, were
abolished in 1873, and since 1890 all born in slavery are free
on reaching their 21st year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buddhism.</div>

<p>Siamese Buddhism is a slightly modified form of that
prevailing in Ceylon, although strictly practised but by few.
There are two classes or "sects," the reformers
who attach more importance to the observance
of the canon law than to meditation, and the old believers,
some devoted to a contemplative life, others to the study of
the sunless wilderness of Buddhist writings. But, beneath it
all, spirit or devil-worship is still rife, and in many districts
pure animism is practically the only religion. Even temples
and shrines have been raised to the countless gods of land
and water, woods, mountains, villages and households. To
these gods are credited all sorts of calamities, and to prevent
them from getting into the bodies of the dead the latter are
brought out, not through door or window, but through
a breach in the wall, which is afterwards carefully built up.
Similar ideas prevail amongst many other peoples, both at
higher and lower levels of culture, for nothing is more
ineradicable than such popular beliefs associated with the
relations presumed to exist between the present and the after
life.</p>

<p>Incredible sums are yearly lavished in offerings to the
spirits, which give rise to an endless round of feasts and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
revels, and also in support of the numerous Buddhist temples,
convents, and their inmates. The treasures accumulated in
the "royal cloisters" and other shrines represent a great part
of the national savings&mdash;investments for the other world,
among which are said to be numerous gold statues glittering
with rubies, sapphires, and other priceless gems. But in
these matters the taste of the <i>talapoins</i><a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>, as the priests were
formerly called, is somewhat catholic, including pictures of
reviews and battle-scenes from the European illustrated
papers, and sometimes even statues of Napoleon set up by
the side of Buddha.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Monasticism
and Pessimism.</div>

<p>So numerous, absurd, and exacting are the rules of the
monastic communities that, but for the aid of the temple
servants and novices, existence would be impossible.
A list of such puerilities occupies
several pages in A. R. Colquhoun's work
<i>Amongst the Shans</i> (219-231), and from these we learn that
the monks must not dig the ground, so that they can neither
plant nor sow; must not boil rice, as it would kill the germ;
eat corn for the same reason; climb trees lest a branch get
broken; kindle a flame, as it destroys the fuel; put out
a flame, as that also would extinguish life; forge iron, as
sparks would fly out and perish; swing their arms in walking;
wink in speaking; buy or sell; stretch the legs when sitting;
breed poultry, pigs, or other animals; mount an elephant or
palanquin; wear red, black, green, or white garments; mourn
for the dead, etc., etc. In a word all might be summed up
by a general injunction neither to do anything, nor not to do
anything, and then despair of attaining <i>Nirvana</i>; for it would
be impossible to conceive of any more pessimistic system in
theory<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>. Practically it is otherwise, and in point of fact the
utmost religious indifference prevails amongst all classes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Annamese.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Origins.</div>

<p>Within the Mongolic division it would be difficult to
imagine any more striking contrast than that presented by
the gentle, kindly, and on the whole not ill-favoured Siamese,
and their hard-featured, hard-hearted, and grasping Annamese
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>neighbours. Let anyone, who may fancy there is little or
nothing in blood, pass rapidly from the bright,
genial&mdash;if somewhat listless and corrupt&mdash;social
life of Bangkok to the dry, uncongenial moral atmosphere of
Ha-noi or Saigon, and he will be apt to modify his views on
that point. Few observers have a good word to say for the
Tonkingese, the Cochin-Chinese, or any other branch of the
Annamese family, and some even of the least prejudiced are
so outspoken that we must needs infer there is good ground for
their severe strictures on these strange, uncouth materialists.
Buddhists of course they are nominally; but of the moral
sense they have little, unless it be (amongst the lettered
classes) a pale reflection of the pale Chinese ethical code.
The whole region in fact is a sort of attenuated China, to
which it owes its arts and industries, its letters, moral systems,
general culture, and even a large part of its inhabitants.
<i>Giao-shi</i> (<i>Kiao-shi</i>), the name of the aborigines, said to mean
"Bifurcated," or "Cross-toes<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>," in reference to
the wide space between the great toe and the
next, occurs in the legendary Chinese records so far back as
2285 <small>B.C.</small>, since which period the two countries are supposed
to have maintained almost uninterrupted relations, whether
friendly or hostile, down to the present day. At first the
Giao-shi were confined to the northern parts of Lu-kiang, the
present Tonking, all the rest of the coastlands being held by
the powerful Champa (Tsiampa) people, whose affinities are
with the Oceanic populations. But in 218 <small>B.C.</small>, Lu-kiang
having been reduced and incorporated with China proper,
a large number of Chinese emigrants settled in the country,
and gradually merged with the Giao-shi in a single nationality,
whose twofold descent is still reflected in the Annamese
physical and mental characters.</p>

<p>This term Annam<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>, however, did not come into use till the
seventh century, when it was officially applied to the frontier
river between China and Tonking, and afterwards extended
to the whole of Tonking and Cochin-China. Tonking itself,
meaning the "Eastern Court<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>," was originally the name only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
of the city of Ha-noi when it was a royal residence, but was
later extended to the whole of the northern kingdom, whose
true name is <i>Y&uuml;eh-nan</i>. To this corresponded the southern
Kwe-Chen-Ching, "Kingdom of Chen-Ching," which was so
named in the ninth century from its capital Chen-Ching, and
of which our Cochin-China appears to be a corrupt form.</p>

<p>But, amid all this troublesome political nomenclature, the
dominant Annamese nation has faithfully preserved its homogeneous
character, spreading, like the Siamese Shans, steadily
southwards, and gradually absorbing the whole of the Champa
domain to the southern extremity of the peninsula, as well as
a large part of the ancient kingdom of Camboja about the
Mekhong delta. They thus form at present the almost
exclusive ethnical element throughout all the lowland and
cultivated parts of Tonking, upper and lower Cochin-China
and south Camboja, with a total population in 1898 of about
twenty millions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physical and
Mental
Characters.</div>

<p>The Annamese are described in a semi-official report<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> as
characterised by a high broad forehead, high cheek-bones,
small crushed nose, rather thick lips, black hair,
scant beard, mean height, coppery complexion,
deceitful (<i>rus&eacute;e</i>) expression, and rude or insolent
bearing. The head is round (index 83 to 84) and the features
are in general flat and coarse, while to an ungainly exterior
corresponds a harsh unsympathetic temperament. The Abb&eacute;
Gagelin, who lived years in their midst, frankly declares that
they are at once arrogant and dishonest, and dead to all the
finer feelings of human nature, so that after years of absence
the nearest akin will meet without any outward sign of
pleasure or affection. Others go further, and J. G. Scott
summed it all up by declaring that "the fewer Annamese
there are, the less taint there is on the human race." No
doubt Lord Curzon gives a more favourable picture, but this
traveller spent only a short time in the country, and even he
allows that they are "tricky and deceitful, disposed to thieve
when they get the chance, mendacious, and incurable
gamblers<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>."</p>

<p>Yet they have one redeeming quality, an intense love of
personal freedom, strangely contrasting with the almost abject
slavish spirit of the Siamese. The feeling extends to all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
classes, so that servitude is held in abhorrence, and, as in
Burma, a democratic sense of equality permeates the social
system<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>. Hence, although the State has always been an
absolute monarchy, each separate commune constitutes a
veritable little oligarchic commonwealth. This has come as
a great surprise to the present French administrators of the
country, who frankly declare that they cannot hope to improve
the social or political position of the people by substituting
European for native laws and usages. The Annamese have
in fact little to learn from western social institutions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Language and
Letters.</div>

<p>Their language, spoken everywhere with remarkable
uniformity, is of the normal Indo-Chinese isolating type,
possessing six tones, three high, and three low,
and written in ideographic characters based on
the Chinese, but with numerous modifications
and additions. But, although these are ill-suited for the purpose,
the attempt made by the early Portuguese missionaries
to substitute the so-called <i>qu&ocirc;c-ng&ugrave;</i>, or Roman phonetic system,
has been defeated by the conservative spirit of the people.
Primary instruction has long been widely diffused, and almost
everybody can read and write as many of the numerous
hieroglyphs as are needed for the ordinary purpose of daily
intercourse. Every village has its free school, and a higher
range of studies is encouraged by the public examinations to
which, as in China, all candidates for government appointments
are subjected. Under such a scheme surprising results might
be achieved, were the course of studies not based exclusively
on the empty formulas of Chinese classical literature. The
subjects taught are for the most part puerile, and true science
is replaced by the dry moral precepts of Confucius. One
result amongst the educated classes is a scoffing, sceptical
spirit, free from all religious prejudice, and unhampered by
theological creeds or dogmas, combined with a lofty moral
tone, not always however in harmony with daily conduct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious
Systems.</div>

<p>Even more than in China, the family is the true base of
the social system, the head of the household being not only
the high-priest of the ancestral cult, but also
a kind of patriarch enjoying almost absolute
control over his children.  In this respect the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
relations are somewhat one-sided, the father having no
recognised obligations towards his offspring, while these are
expected to show him perfect obedience in life and veneration
after death. Besides this worship of ancestry and the Confucian
ethical philosophy, a national form of Buddhism is
prevalent. Some even profess all three of these so-called
"religions," beneath which there still survive many of the
primitive superstitions associated with a not yet extinct belief
in spirits and the supernatural power of magicians. While
the Buddhist temples are neglected and the few bonzes<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>
despised, offerings are still made to the genii of agriculture,
of the waters, the tiger, the dolphin, peace, war, diseases, and
so forth, whose rude statues in the form of dragons or other
fabulous monsters are even set up in the pagodas. Since the
early part of the seventeenth century Roman Catholic
missionaries have laboured with considerable success in this
unpromising field, where the congregations were estimated in
1898 at about 900,000.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Chinese.</div>

<p>From Annam the ethnical transition is easy to China<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> and
its teeming multitudes, regarding whose origins, racial and
cultural, two opposite views at present hold the
field. What may be called the old, but by no
means the obsolete school, regards the Chinese populations
as the direct descendants of the aborigines who during the
Stone Ages entered the Hoang-ho valley probably from the
Tibetan plateau, there developed their peculiar culture independently
of foreign influences, and thence spread gradually
southwards to the whole of China proper, extirpating,
absorbing, or driving to the encircling western and southern
uplands the ruder aborigines of the Yang-tse-Kiang and Si-Kiang
basins.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Babylonian
Theory.</div>

<p>In direct opposition to this view the new school, championed
especially by T. de Lacouperie<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>, holds that the present inhabitants
of China are late intruders from south-western
Asia, and that they arrived not as rude
aborigines, but as a cultured people with a
considerable knowledge of letters, science, and the arts, all
of which they acquired either directly or indirectly from the
civilised Akkado-Sumerian inhabitants of Babylonia.</p>

<p>Not merely analogies and resemblances, but what are
called actual identities, are pointed out between the two
cultures, and even between the two languages, sufficient to
establish a common origin of both, Mesopotamia being the
fountain-head, whence the stream flowed by channels not
clearly defined to the Hoang-ho valley. Thus the Chin. <i>yu</i>,
originally <i>go</i>, is equated with Akkad <i>gu</i>, to speak; <i>ye</i> with <i>ge</i>,
night, and so on. Then the astronomic and chronologic
systems are compared, Berossus and the cuneiform tablets
dividing the prehistoric Akkad epoch into 10 periods of
10 kings, lasting 120 Sari, or 432,000 years, while the corresponding
Chinese astronomic myth also comprises 10 kings
(or dynasties) covering the same period of 432,000 years.
The astronomic system credited to the emperor Yao (2000 <small>B.C.</small>)
similarly corresponds with the Akkadian, both having the
same five planets with names of like meaning, and a year of
12 months and 30 days, with the same cycle of intercalated
days, while several of the now obsolete names of the Chinese
months answer to those of the Babylonians. Even the name
of the first Chinese emperor who built an observatory,
Nai-Kwang-ti, somewhat resembles that of the Elamite king,
Kuder-na-hangti, who conquered Chaldaea about 2280 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>All this can hardly be explained away as a mere series of
coincidences; nevertheless neither Sinologues nor Akkadists
are quite convinced, and it is obvious that many of the
resemblances may be due to trade or intercourse both by the
old overland caravan routes, and by the seaborne traffic from
Eridu at the head of the Persian Gulf, which was a flourishing
emporium 4000 or 5000 years ago.</p>

<p>But, despite some verbal analogies, an almost insurmountable
difficulty is presented by the Akkadian and Chinese<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
languages, which no philological ingenuity can bring into
such relation as is required by the hypothesis. T. G. Pinches
has shown that at a very early period, say some 5000 years
ago, Akkadian already consisted, "for the greater part, of
words of one syllable," and was "greatly affected by phonetic
decay, the result being that an enormous number of homophones
were developed out of roots originally quite distinct<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>."
This Akkadian scholar sends me a number of instances, such
as <i>tu</i> for <i>tura</i>, to enter; <i>ti</i> for <i>tila</i>, to live; <i>du</i> for <i>dumu</i>, son;
<i>du</i> for <i>dugu</i>, good, as in <i>Eridu</i>, for <i>Gurudugu</i>, "the good
city," adding that "the list could be extended indefinitely<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>."
But de Lacouperie's Bak tribes, that is, the first immigrants
from south-west Asia, are not supposed to have reached
North China till about 2500 or 3000 <small>B.C.</small>, at which time the
Chinese language was still in the untoned agglutinating state,
with but few monosyllabic homophones, and consequently
quite distinct from the Akkadian, as known to us from the
Assyrian syllabaries, bilingual lists, and earlier tablets from
Nippur or Lagash.</p>

<p>Hence the linguistic argument seems to fail completely,
while the Babylonian origin of the Chinese writing system, or
rather, the derivation of Chinese and Sumerian from some
common parent in Central Asia, awaits further evidence.
Many of the Chinese and Akkadian "line forms" collated by
C. J. Ball<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> are so simple and, one might say, obvious, that
they seem to prove nothing. They may be compared with
such infantile utterances as <i>pa</i>, <i>ma</i>, <i>da</i>, <i>ta</i>, occurring in half
the languages of the world, without proving a connection or
affinity between any of them. But even were the common
origin of the two scripts established, it would prove nothing
as to the common origin of the two peoples, but only show
cultural influences, which need not be denied.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chinese Culture
and Social
System.</div>

<p>But if Chinese origins cannot be clearly traced back to
Babylonia, Chinese culture may still, in a sense, claim to be
the oldest in the world, inasmuch as it has
persisted with little change from its rise some
4500 years ago down to present times.  All
other early civilisations&mdash;Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Assyrian,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
Persian, Hellenic&mdash;have perished, or live only in their monuments,
traditions, oral or written records. But the Chinese,
despite repeated political and social convulsions, is still as
deeply rooted in the past as ever, showing no break of
continuity from the dim echoes of remote prehistoric ages
down to the last revolution, and the establishment of the
Republic. These things touch the surface only of the great
ocean of Chinese humanity, which is held together, not
by any general spirit of national sentiment (all sentiment is
alien from the Chinese temperament), nor by any community
of speech, for many of the provincial dialects differ profoundly
from each other, but by a prodigious power of inertia, which
has hitherto resisted all attempts at change either by pressure
from without, or by spontaneous impulse from within.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letters and
Early Records.</div>

<p>What they were thousands of years ago, the Chinese still
are, a frugal, peace-loving, hard-working people, occupied
mainly with tillage and trade, cultivating few arts beyond
weaving, porcelain and metal work, but with a widely diffused
knowledge of letters, and a writing system which
still remains at the cumbrous ideographic stage,
needing as many different symbols as there are
distinct concepts to be expressed. Yet the system has one
advantage, enabling those who speak mutually unintelligible
idioms to converse together, using the pencil instead of the
tongue. For this very reason the attempts made centuries
ago by the government to substitute a phonetic script had to
be abandoned. It was found that imperial edicts and other
documents so written could not be understood by the populations
speaking dialects different from the literary standard,
whereas the hieroglyphs, like our ciphers 1, 2, 3 ..., could be
read by all educated persons of whatever allied form of speech.</p>

<p>Originally the Chinese system, whether developed on the
spot or derived from Akkadian or any other foreign source,
was of course pictographic or ideographic, and it is commonly
supposed to have remained at that stage ever since, the only
material changes being of a graphic nature. The pictographs
were conventionalised and reduced to their present form, but
still remained ideograms supplemented by a limited number
of phonetic determinants. But de Lacouperie has shown that
this view is a mistake, and that the evolution from the
pictograph to the phonetic symbol had been practically completed
in China many centuries before the new era. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
<i>Ku-wen</i> style current before the ninth century <small>B.C.</small> "was
really the phonetic expression of speech<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>." But for the
reason stated it had to be discontinued, and a return made to
the earlier ideographic style. The change was effected
about 820 <small>B.C.</small> by She Ch&ouml;u, minister of the Emperor S&uuml;en
Wang, who introduced the <i>Ta-chuen</i> style in which "he tried
to speak to the eye and no longer to the ear," that is, he
reverted to the earlier ideographic process, which has since
prevailed. It was simplified about 227 <small>B.C.</small> (<i>Siao Chuen</i>
style), and after some other modifications the present caligraphic
form (<i>Kiai Shu</i>) was introduced by Wang Hi in
350 <small>A.D.</small> Thus one consequence of the "Expansion of China"
was a reversion to barbarism, in respect at least of the national
graphic system, by which Chinese thought and literature have
been hampered for nearly 3000 years.</p>

<p>Written records, though at first mainly of a mythical
character, date from about 3000 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> Reference is made in
the early documents to the rude and savage times, which in
China as elsewhere certainly preceded the historic period.
Three different prehistoric ages are even discriminated, and
tradition relates how Fu-hi introduced wooden, Thin-ming
stone, and Shi-yu metal implements<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>. Later, when their
origin and use were forgotten, the jade axes, like those from
Yunnan, were looked on as bolts hurled to the earth by the
god of thunder, while the arrow-heads, supposed to be also of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
divine origin, were endowed in the popular fancy with special
virtues and even regarded as emblems of sovereignty. Thus
may perhaps be explained the curious fact that in early times,
before the twelfth century <small>B.C.</small>, tribute in flint weapons was
paid to the imperial government by some of the reduced wild
tribes of the western uplands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early
Migrations.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Absorption of
the Aborigines.</div>

<p>These men of the Stone and Metal Ages are no doubt
still largely represented, not only amongst the rude hill tribes
of the southern and western borderlands, but
also amongst the settled and cultured lowlanders
of the great fluvial valleys. The "Hundred
Families," as the first immigrants called themselves, came
traditionally from the north-western regions beyond the
Hoang-ho. According to the Yu-kung their original home
lay in the south-western part of Eastern Turkestan, whence
they first migrated east to the oases north of the Nan-Shan
range, and then, in the fourth millennium before the new
era, to the fertile valleys of the Hoang-ho and its Hoe&iuml;-ho
tributary. Thence they spread slowly along the other great
river valleys, partly expelling, partly intermingling with the
aborigines, but so late as the seventh century <small>B.C.</small>
were still mainly confined to the region between
the Pe&iuml;-ho and the lower Yang-tse-Kiang. Even
here several indigenous groups, such as the Hoe&iuml;, whose name
survives in that of the Hoe&iuml; river, and the La&iuml; of the
Shantong Peninsula, long held their ground, but all were
ultimately absorbed or assimilated throughout the northern
lands as far south as the left bank of the Yang-tse-Kiang.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Survivals&mdash;Hok-lo;
Hakka; Pun-ti.</div>

<p>Beyond this river many were also merged in the dominant
people continually advancing southwards; but others, collectively
or vaguely known as Si-fans, Mans, Miao-tse,
Pa&iuml;, Tho, Y-jen<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>, Lolo, etc., were driven to
the south-western highlands which they still
occupy. Even some of the populations in the settled districts,
such as the <i>Hok-los</i><a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>, and <i>Hakkas</i><a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>, of Kwang-tung, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
<i>Pun-ti</i><a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> of the Canton district, are scarcely yet thoroughly
assimilated. They differ greatly in temperament, usages,
appearance, and speech from the typical Chinese of the
Central and Northern provinces, whom in fact they look
upon as "foreigners," and with whom they hold intercourse
through "Pidgin English<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>," the <i>lingua franca</i> of the Chinese
seaboard<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confucianism.</div>

<p>Nevertheless a general homogeneous character is imparted
to the whole people by their common political, social, and
religious institutions, and by that principle of convergence in
virtue of which different ethnical groups, thrown together in
the same area and brought under a single administration, tend
to merge in a uniform new national type. This general
uniformity is conspicuous especially in the religious ideas
which, except in the sceptical lettered circles, everywhere
underlie the three recognised national religions, or "State
Churches," as they might almost be called: <i>ju-kiao</i>, Confucianism;
<i>tao-kiao</i>, Taoism; and <i>fo-kiao</i>, Buddhism (Fo
= Buddha). The first, confined mainly to the educated upper
classes, is not so much a religion as a philosophic system,
a frigid ethical code based on the moral and matter-of-fact
teachings of Confucius<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>. Confucius was essentially
a social and political reformer, who taught
by example and precept; the main inducement to virtue being,
not rewards or penalties in the after-life, but well- or ill-being
in the present. His system is summed up in the expression
"worldly wisdom," as embodied in such popular sayings as:
A friend is hardly made in a year, but unmade in a moment;
When safe remember danger, in peace forget not war; Filial
father, filial son, unfilial father, unfilial son; In washing up,
plates and dishes may get broken; Don't do what you would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
not have known; Thatch your roof before the rain, dig the
well before you thirst; The gambler's success is his ruin;
Money goes to the gambling den as the criminal to execution
(never returns); Money hides many faults; Stop the hand,
stop the mouth (stop work and starve); To open a shop is
easy, to keep it open hard; Win your lawsuit and lose your
money.</p>

<p>Although he instituted no religious system, Confucius
nevertheless enjoined the observance of the already existing
forms of worship, and after death became himself the object
of a widespread cult, which still persists. "In every city
there is a temple, built at the public expense, containing either
a statue of the philosopher, or a tablet inscribed with his titles.
Every spring and autumn worship is paid to him in these
temples by the chief official personages of the city. In the
schools also, on the first and fifteenth of each month, his title
being written on red paper and affixed to a tablet, worship is
performed in a special room by burning incense and candles,
and by prostrations<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Taoism.</div>

<p>Taoism, a sort of pantheistic mysticism, called by its
founder, Lao-tse (600 <small>B.C.</small>), the <i>Tao</i>, or "way of salvation,"
was embodied in the formula "matter and the
visible world are merely manifestations of a
sublime, eternal, incomprehensible principle." It taught, in
anticipation of Sakya-Muni, that by controlling his passions
man may escape or cut short an endless series of transmigrations,
and thus arrive by the Tao at everlasting bliss&mdash;sleep?
unconscious rest or absorption in the eternal essence?
Nirvana? It is impossible to tell from the lofty but
absolutely unintelligible language in which the master's
teachings are wrapped.</p>

<p>But it matters little, because his disciples have long
forgotten the principles they never understood, and Taoism
has almost everywhere been transformed to a system of
magic associated with the never-dying primeval superstitions.
Originally there was no hierarchy of priests, the only specially
religious class being the Ascetics, who passed their lives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
absorbed in the contemplation of the eternal verities. But
out of this class, drawn together by their common interests, was
developed a kind of monasticism, with an organised brotherhood
of astrologers, magicians, Shamanists, somnambulists,
"mediums," "thought-readers," charlatans and impostors of
all sorts, sheltered under a threadbare garb of religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buddhism.</div>

<p>Buddhism also, although of foreign origin, has completely
conformed to the national spirit, and is now a curious blend
of Hindu metaphysics with the primitive Chinese
belief in spirits and a deified ancestry. In every
district are practised diverse forms of worship between which
no clear dividing line can be drawn, and, as in Annam, the
same persons may be at once followers of Confucius, Lao-tse,
and Buddha. In fact such was the position of the Emperor,
who belonged <i>ex officio</i> to all three of these State religions,
and scrupulously took part in their various observances.
There is even some truth in the Chinese view that "all three
make but one religion," the first appealing to man's moral
nature, the second to the instinct of self-preservation, the
third to the higher sphere of thought and contemplation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fung-shui and
Ancestry
Worship.</div>

<p>But behind, one might say above it all, the old animism
still prevails, manifested in a multitude of superstitious practices,
whose purport is to appease the evil and secure
the favour of the good spirits, the <i>Feng-shui</i> or
<i>Fung-shui</i>, "air and water" genii, who have to
be reckoned with in all the weightiest as well as the most
trivial occurrences of daily life. These with the ghosts of
their ancestors, by whom the whole land is haunted, are the
bane of the Chinaman's existence. Everything depends on
maintaining a perfect balance between the Fung-shui, that is,
the two principles represented by the "White Tiger" and
the "Azure Dragon," who guard the approaches of every
dwelling, and whose opposing influences have to be nicely
adjusted by the well-paid professors of the magic arts. At
the death of the emperor Tung Chih (1875) a great difficulty
was raised by the State astrologers, who found that the realm
would be endangered if he were buried, according to rule, in
the imperial cemetery 100 miles west of Pekin, as his father
reposed in the other imperial cemetery situated the same
distance east of the capital. For some subtle reason the
balance would have been disturbed between Tiger and Dragon,
and it took nine months to settle the point, during which, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
reported by the American Legation, the whole empire was
stirred, councils of State agitated, and &pound;50,000 expended to
decide where the remains of a worthless and vicious young
man should be interred.</p>

<p>Owing to the necessary disturbance of the ancestral burial
places, much trouble has been anticipated in the construction
of the railways, for which concessions have now been granted
to European syndicates. But an Englishman long resident
in the country has declared that there will be no resistance on
the part of the people. "The dead can be removed with due
regard to Fung Shui; a few dollars will make that all right."
This is fully in accordance with the thrifty character of the
Chinese, which overrides all other considerations, as expressed
in the popular saying: "With money you may move the
gods; without it you cannot move men." But the gods may
even be moved without money, or at least with spurious
paper money, for it is a fixed belief of their votaries that, like
mortals, they may be outwitted by such devices. When
rallied for burning flash notes at a popular shrine, since no
spirit-bank would cash them, a Chinaman retorted: "Why
me burn good note? Joss no can savvy." In a similar
spirit the god of war is hoodwinked by wooden boards hung
on the ramparts of Pekin and painted to look like heavy
ordnance.</p>

<p>In fact appearance, outward show, observance of the
"eleventh commandment," in a word "face" as it is called, is
everything in China. "To understand, however imperfectly,
what is meant by 'face,' we must take account of the fact that
as a race the Chinese have a strong dramatic instinct. Upon
very slight provocation any Chinese regards himself in the
light of an actor in a drama. A Chinese thinks in theatrical
terms. If his troubles are adjusted he speaks of himself as
having 'got off the stage' with credit, and if they are not
adjusted he finds no way to 'retire from the stage.' The
question is never of facts, but always of form. Once rightly
apprehended, 'face' will be found to be in itself a key to the
combination-lock of many of the most important characteristics
of the Chinese<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Islam and
Christianity.</div>

<p>Of foreign religions Islam, next to Buddhism, has made
most progress. Introduced by the early Arab and Persian
traders, and zealously preached throughout the
Jagatai empire in the twelfth century, it has
secured a firm footing especially in Kan-su,
Shen-si, and Yunnan, and is of course dominant in Eastern
(Chinese) Turkestan. Despite the wholesale butcheries that
followed the repeated insurrections between 1855 and 1877,
the <i>Hoe&iuml;-Hoe&iuml;</i>, <i>Panthays</i>, or <i>Dungans</i>, as the Muhammadans
are variously called, were still estimated, in 1898, at about
22,000,000 in the whole empire.</p>

<p>Islam was preceded by Christianity, which, as attested by
the authentic inscription of Si-ngan-fu, penetrated into the
western provinces under the form of Nestorianism about the
seventh century. The famous Roman Catholic missions with
headquarters at Pekin date from the close of the sixteenth
century, and despite internal dissensions have had a fair
measure of success, the congregations comprising altogether
over one million members. Protestant missions date from 1807
(London Missionary Society) and in 1910 claimed over 200,000
church members and baptized Christians, the total having
more than doubled since 1900<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned dissensions arose out of the practices
associated with ancestry worship, offerings of flowers, fruits
and so forth, which the Jesuits regarded merely as proofs of
filial devotion, but were denounced by the Dominicans as acts
of idolatry. After many years of idle controversy, the question
was at last decided against the Jesuits by Clement XI in the
famous Bull, <i>Ex illa die</i> (1715), and since then, neophytes
having to renounce the national cult of their forefathers, conversions
have mainly been confined to the lower classes, too
humble to boast of any family tree, or too poor to commemorate
the dead by ever-recurring costly sepulchral rites.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mandarin
Class.</div>

<p>In China there are no hereditary nobles, indeed no nobles
at all, unless it be the rather numerous descendants of Confucius
who dwell together and enjoy certain social privileges, in this
somewhat resembling the <i>Shorfa</i> (descendants of the Prophet)
in Muhammadan lands. If any titles have to be awarded for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>great deeds they fall, not on the hero, but on his forefathers,
and thus at a stroke of the vermilion pencil are ennobled
countless past generations, while the last of the line remains
unhonoured until he goes over to the majority. Between the
Emperor, "patriarch of his people," and the people themselves,
however, there stood an aristocracy of talent, or
at least of Chinese scholarship, the governing
Mandarin<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> class, which was open to the highest
and the lowest alike. All nominations to office were conferred
exclusively on the successful competitors at the public examinations,
so that, like the French conscript with the hypothetical
Marshal's b&acirc;ton in his knapsack, every Chinese citizen carried
the buttoned cap of official rank in his capacious sleeve. Of
these there are nine grades, indicated respectively in descending
order by the ruby, red coral, sapphire, opaque blue, crystal,
white shell, gold (two), and silver button, or rather little
globe, on the cap of office, with which correspond the nine
birds&mdash;manchu crane, golden pheasant, peacock, wild goose,
silver pheasant, egret, mandarin duck, quail, and jay&mdash;embroidered
on the breast and back of the State robe.</p>

<p>Theoretically the system is admirable, and at all events is
better than appointments by Court favour. But in practice it
was vitiated, first by the narrow, antiquated course of studies in
the dry Chinese classics, calculated to produce pedants rather
than statesmen, and secondly by the monopoly of preference
which it conferred on a lettered caste to the exclusion of men of
action, vigour, and enterprise. Moreover, appointments being
made for life, barring crime or blunder, the Mandarins, as
long as they approved themselves zealous supporters of the
reigning dynasty, enjoyed a free hand in amassing wealth by
plunder, and the wealth thus acquired was used to purchase
further promotion and advancement, rather than to improve
the welfare of the people.</p>

<p>They have the reputation of being a courteous people,
as punctilious as the Malays themselves; and they are so
amongst each other. But their attitude towards strangers is
the embodiment of aggressive self-righteousness, a complacent
feeling of superiority which nothing can disturb. Even the
upper classes, with all their efforts to be at least polite, often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
betray the feeling in a subdued arrogance which is not always
to be distinguished from vulgar insolence. "After the
courteous, kindly Japanese, the Chinese seem indifferent,
rough, and disagreeable, except the well-to-do merchants in
the shops, who are bland, complacent, and courteous. Their
rude stare, and the way they hustle you in the streets and
shout their 'pidjun' English at you is not attractive<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>." But
the stare, the hustling and the shouting may not be due to
incivility. No doubt the Chinaman regards the foreigner as
a "devil" but he has reason, and he never ceases to be
astonished at foreign manners and customs "extremely ferocious
and almost entirely uncivilised<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>."</p>

comprises dialects of very different kinds; some approach Tibetan and the North
Assam group, others lead over to the Bodo, others connect with Tibeto-Burman.
Meitei lies midway between Kuki-Chin and Kachin, and these merge finally in
Burmese. Grierson's <i>Linguistic Survey of India</i>, Vol. <small>III.</small> 1903-6.</p></div>

<i>Kuki</i> is unknown to the people themselves, while <i>Lushai</i> is only the name of a
single group proud of their head-hunting proclivities, hence they call themselves,
or perhaps are called <i>Lu-Shai</i>, "Head-Cutters," from <i>lu</i> head, <i>sha</i> to cut (G. H.
Damant). Other explanations suggested by C. A. Soppitt (<i>Kuki-Lushai Tribes,

been largely assimilated in type to the Burmese and in one place goes so far as to
assert that "the Ngiou are decidedly of the same race as the Burmese. I have
had opportunities of seeing hundreds of both countries, and of closely watching
their features and build. The Ngiou wear the hair in a topknot in the same way
as the Burmese, but they are easily distinguished by their tattooing, which is
much more elaborate" (<i>Temples and Elephants</i>, 1884, p. 297). Of course all
spring from one primeval stock, but they now constitute distinct ethnical groups,
and, except about the borderlands, where blends may be suspected, both the
physical and mental characters differ considerably. Bock's <i>Ngiou</i> is no doubt
the same name as <i>Ngnio</i>, which H. S. Hallett applies in one place to the Moss&eacute;
Shans north of Zimme, and elsewhere to the Burmese Shans collectively (<i>A

us an account of a wonderful Lolo MS. on satin, red on one side, blue on the
other, containing nearly 5750 words written in black, "apparently with the
Chinese brush." The MS. was obtained by E. Colborne Baber from a Lolo chief,
forwarded to Europe in 1881, and described by de Lacouperie, <i>Journ. R. As. Soc.</i>
Vol. <small>XIV.</small> Part <small>I</small>. "The writing runs in lines from top to bottom and from left
to right, as in Chinese" (p. 1), and this authority regards it as the link that was
wanting to connect the various members of a widely diffused family radiating
from India (Harapa seal, Indo-Pali, Vatteluttu) to Malaysia (Batta, Rejang,
Lampong, Bugis, Makassar, Tagal), to Indo-China (Lao, Siamese, Lolo), Korea
and Japan, and also including the Siao-chuen Chinese system "in use a few
centuries <small>B.C.</small>" (p. 5). It would be premature to say that all these connections
are established.</p></div>

nation of <i>Man-tse</i> with 18 tribal divisions, reaching from West Yunnan to the
extreme north of Sechuen, a sort of federacy recognising a king, with Chinese
habits and dress, but speaking a language resembling Sanskrit (?). These were
the <i>Sumu</i>, or "White Man-tse," apparently the same as those visited in 1896 by
Mrs Bishop, and by her described as semi-independent, ruled by their own chiefs,
and in appearance "quite Caucasian, both men and women being very handsome,"
strict Buddhists, friendly and hospitable, and living in large stone houses (Letter

time (about 1340) Camboja had already been reduced, and the Siamese conquerors
had brought back from its renowned capital, Angkor Wat, over 90,000 captives.
These were largely employed in the wars of the period, which were thus attributed
to Camboja instead of to Siam by foreign peoples ignorant of the changed relations
in Indo-China.</p></div>

picture of maladministration, vice, and corruption still prevalent so late as 1890,
given by Hallett in <i>A Thousand Miles on an Elephant</i>, Ch. xxxv.; and even still
later by H. Warington Smyth in <i>Five Years in Siam, from 1891 to 1896</i> (1898).
This observer credits the Siamese with an undeveloped sense of right and wrong,
so that they are good only by accident. "To do a thing because it is right is
beyond them; to abstain from a thing because it is against their good name, or
involves serious consequences, is possibly within the power of a few; the question
of right and wrong does not enter the calculation." But he thinks they may
possess a high degree of intelligence, and mentions the case of a peasant, who
from an atlas had taught himself geography and politics. P. A. Thompson, <i>Lotus
Land</i>, 1906, gives an account of the country and people of Southern Siam.</p></div>

founders of the Li&acirc;o dynasty, which was overthrown 1115 <small>A.D.</small> by the N&uuml;-Ch&#259;n

Emperor Ta Y&uuml; (2200 <small>B.C.</small>), when it is mentioned as an article of tribute in the
<i>Shu-King</i>. F. Hirth, who states this fact, adds that during the same period,
if not even earlier, iron was already a flourishing industry in the Liang district
(Paper on the "History of Chinese Culture," Munich Anthropological Society,
April, 1898). At the discussion which followed the reading of this paper Montelius
argued that iron was unknown in Western Asia and Egypt before 1500 <small>B.C.</small>,
although the point was contested by Hommel, who quoted a word for iron in
the earliest Egyptian texts. Montelius, however, explained that terms originally
meaning "ore" or "metal" were afterwards used for "iron." Such was certainly
the case with the Gk. <span class = "greek" title = "chalkos">&#967;&#945;&#955;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span>,
at first "copper," then metal in general, and used still later for
<span class = "greek" title = "sid&ecirc;ros">&#963;&#943;&#948;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, "iron"; hence
<span class = "greek" title = "chalkeus">&#967;&#945;&#955;&#954;&#949;&#973;&#962;</span> = coppersmith, blacksmith, and even
goldsmith. So also with the Lat. <i>aes</i> (Sanskrit <i>ayas</i>, akin to <i>aurora</i>, with simple
idea of brightness), used first especially for copper (<i>aes cyprium, cuprum</i>), and
then for <i>bronze</i> (Lewis and Short). For Hirth's later views see his <i>Ancient
History of China</i>, 1908 (from the fabulous ages to 221 <small>B.C.</small>).</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Range of the
Oceanic
Mongols.</div>

<p>In the Oceanic domain, which for ethnical purposes begins
at the neck of the Malay Peninsula, the Mongol peoples range
from Madagascar eastwards to Formosa and
Micronesia, but are found in compact masses
chiefly on the mainland, in the Sunda Islands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
(Sumatra, Java, Bali, Lombok, Borneo, Celebes) and in the
Philippines. Even here they have mingled in many places
with other populations, forming fresh ethnical groups, in
which the Mongol element is not always conspicuous. Such
fusions have taken place with the Negrito aborigines in
the Malay Peninsula and the Philippines; with Papuans in
Micronesia, Flores, and other islands east of Lombok; with
dolichocephalic Indonesians in Sumatra, Borneo, Celebes,
Halmahera (Jilolo), parts of the Philippines<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>, and perhaps also
Timor and Ceram; and with African negroes (Bantu) in
Madagascar. To unravel some of these racial entanglements
is one of the most difficult tasks in anthropology, and in the
absence of detailed information cannot yet be everywhere
attempted with any prospect of success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The term
"Malay."</div>

<p>The problem has been greatly, though perhaps inevitably
complicated by the indiscriminate extension of the term
"Malay" to all these and even to other mixed
Oceanic populations farther east, as, for instance,
in the expression "Malayo-Polynesian," applied
by many writers not only in a linguistic, but also in an ethnical
sense, to most of the insular peoples from Madagascar to Easter
Island, and from Hawaii to New Zealand. It is now of
course too late to hope to remedy this misuse of terms by
proposing a fresh nomenclature. But much of the consequent
confusion will be avoided by restricting <i>Malayo-Polynesian</i><a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>

<div class="sidenote">The Historical
Malays.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Migrations and
Present Range.</div>

<p>The essential point to remember is that the true Malays&mdash;who
call themselves <i>Orang-Mal&aacute;yu</i>, speak the standard but
quite modern Malay language, and are all
Muhammadans&mdash;are a historical people who
appear on the scene in relatively recent times,
ages after the insular world had been occupied by the Mongol
peoples to whom their name has been extended, but who
never call themselves Malays. The Orang-Mal&aacute;yu, who have
acquired such an astonishing predominance in the Eastern
Archipelago, were originally an obscure tribe who rose to
power in the Menangkabau district, Sumatra, not before the
twelfth century, and whose migrations date only from about
the year 1160 <small>A.D.</small> At this time, according to the native
records<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>, was founded the first foreign settlement, Singapore,
a pure Sanskrit name meaning the "Lion City," from which
it might be inferred that these first settlers were not Muhammadans,
as is commonly assumed, but Brahmans or Buddhists,
both these forms of Hinduism having been propagated
throughout Sumatra and the other Sunda Islands centuries
before this time. It is also noteworthy that the
early settlers on the mainland are stated to have
been pagans, or to have professed some corrupt
form of Hindu idolatry, till their conversion to Islam by the
renowned Sultan Mahmud Shah about the middle of the
thirteenth century. It is therefore probable enough that the
earlier movements were carried out under Hindu influences,
and may have begun long before the historical date 1160.
Menangkabau, however, was the first Mussulman State that
acquired political supremacy in Sumatra, and this district thus
became the chief centre for the later diffusion of the cultured
Malays, their language, usages, and religion, throughout the
Peninsula and the Archipelago. Here they are now found in
compact masses chiefly in south Sumatra (Menangkabau,
Palembang, the Lampongs); in all the insular groups between
Sumatra and Borneo; in the Malay Peninsula as far north as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
the Kra Isthmus, here intermingling with the Siamese as "Sam-Sams,"
partly Buddhists, partly Muhammadans; round the
coast of Borneo and about the estuaries of that island; in Tidor,
Ternate, and the adjacent coast of Jilolo; in the Banda, Sula,
and Sulu groups; in Batavia, Singapore, and all the other
large seaports of the Archipelago. In all these lands beyond
Sumatra the Orang-Mal&aacute;yu are thus seen to be comparatively
recent arrivals<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>, and in fact intruders on the other Malayan
populations, with whom they collectively constitute the Oceanic
branch of the Mongol division. Their diffusion was everywhere
brought about much in the same way as in Ternate,
where A. R. Wallace tells us that the ruling people "are an
intrusive Malay race somewhat allied to the Macassar people,
who settled in the country at a very early epoch, drove out
the indigenes, who were no doubt the same as those of the
adjacent island of Gilolo, and established a monarchy. They
perhaps obtained many of their wives from the natives, which
will account for the extraordinary language they speak&mdash;in some
respects closely allied to that of the natives of Gilolo, while it
contains much that points to a Malayan [Malay] origin. To
most of these people the Malay language is quite unintelligible<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Malayans&mdash;two
classes;
Rude and
Cultured.</div>

<p>The Malayan populations, as distinguished from the Malays
proper, form socially two very distinct classes&mdash;the <i>Orang
Benua</i>, "Men of the Soil," rude aborigines,
numerous especially in the interior of the Malay
Peninsula, Borneo, Celebes, Jilolo, Timor,
Ceram, the Philippines, Formosa, and Madagascar;
and the cultured peoples, formerly Hindus but now
mostly Muhammadans, who have long been constituted in
large communities and nationalities with historical records,
and flourishing arts and industries. They speak cultivated
languages of the Austronesian family, generally much better
preserved and of richer grammatical structure than the
simplified modern speech of the Orang-Mal&aacute;yu. Such are
the Achinese, Rejangs, and Passumahs of Sumatra; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
Bugis, Mangkassaras and some Minahasans of Celebes<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>; the
Tagalogs and Visayas of the Philippines; the Sassaks and
Balinese of Lombok and Bali (most of these still Hindus);
the Madurese and Javanese proper of Java; and the Hovas of
Madagascar. To call any of these "Malays<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>," is like calling
the Italians "French," or the Germans "English," because of
their respective Romance and Teutonic connections.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Javanese.</div>

<p>Pre&euml;minent in many respects amongst all the Malayan
peoples are the <i>Javanese</i>&mdash;<i>Sundanese</i> in the west, <i>Javanese
proper</i> in the centre, <i>Madurese</i> in the east&mdash;who
were a highly civilised nation while the Sumatran
Malays were still savages, perhaps head-hunters and cannibals
like the neighbouring Battas. Although now almost exclusively
Muhammadans, they had already adopted some form of
Hinduism probably over 2000 years ago, and under the
guidance of their Indian teachers had rapidly developed a very
advanced state of culture. "Under a completely organised
although despotic government, the arts of peace and war were
brought to considerable perfection, and the natives of Java
became famous throughout the East as accomplished musicians
and workers in gold, iron and copper, none of which metals were
found in the island itself. They possessed a regular calendar
with astronomical eras, and a metrical literature, in which,
however, history was inextricably blended with romance.
Bronze and stone inscriptions in the Kavi, or old Javanese
language, still survive from the eleventh or twelfth century,
and to the same dates may be referred the vast ruins of
Brambanam and the stupendous temple of Boro-budor in the
centre of the island. There are few statues of Hindu
divinities in this temple, but many are found in its immediate
vicinity, and from the various archaeological objects collected in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
the district it is evident that both the Buddhist and Brahmanical
forms of Hinduism were introduced at an early date.</p>

<p>"But all came to an end by the overthrow of the chief
Hindu power in 1478, after which event Islam spread rapidly
over the whole of Java and Madura. Brahmanism, however,
still holds its ground in Bali and Lombok, the last strongholds
of Hinduism in the Eastern Archipelago<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Balinese and
Sassaks.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Primitive and
later Religions
and Cultures.</div>

<p>On the obscure religious and social relations in these
Lesser Sundanese Islands much light has been thrown by
Capt. W. Cool, an English translation of whose
work <i>With the Dutch in the East</i> was issued by
E. J. Taylor in 1897. Here it is shown how
Hinduism, formerly dominant throughout a great part of
Malaysia, gradually yielded in some places to a revival of the
never extinct primitive nature-worship, in others to the spread
of Islam, which in Bali alone failed to gain a footing.  In this
island a curious mingling of Buddhist and Brahmanical forms
with the primordial heathendom not only persisted, but was
strong enough to acquire the political ascendancy over the
Mussulman Sassaks of the neighbouring island
of Lombok. Thus while Islam reigns exclusively
in Java&mdash;formerly the chief domain of Hinduism
in the Archipelago&mdash;Bali, Lombok, and even Sumbawa,
present the strange spectacle of large communities professing
every form of belief, from the grossest heathendom to pure
monotheism.</p>

<p>As I have elsewhere pointed out<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>, it is the same with the
cultures and general social conditions, which show an almost
unbroken transition from the savagery of Sumbawa to the
relative degrees of refinement reached by the natives of
Lombok and especially of Bali. Here, however, owing to the
unfavourable political relations, a retrograde movement is
perceptible in the crumbling temples, grass-grown highways,
and neglected homesteads. But it is everywhere evident
enough that "just as Hinduism has only touched the outer
surface of their religion, it has failed to penetrate into their
social institutions, which, like their gods, originate from the
time when Polynesian heathendom was all powerful<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hindu Legends
in Bali.</div>

<p>A striking illustration of the vitality of the early beliefs is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>presented by the local traditions, which relate how these foreign
gods installed themselves in the Lesser Sundanese
Islands after their expulsion from Java by the
Muhammadans in the fifteenth century. Being
greatly incensed at the introduction of the Koran, and also
anxious to avoid contact with the "foreign devils," the
Hindu deities moved eastwards with the intention of setting
up their throne in Bali. But Bali already possessed its own
gods, the wicked Rakshasas, who fiercely resented the
intrusion, but in the struggle that ensued were annihilated,
all but the still reigning Mraya Dewana. Then the new
thrones had to be erected on heights, as in Java; but at
that time there were no mountains in Bali, which was a very
flat country. So the difficulty was overcome by bodily transferring
the four hills at the eastern extremity of Java to the
neighbouring island. Gunong Agong, highest of the four,
was set down in the east, and became the Olympus of Bali,
while the other three were planted in the west, south, and north,
and assigned to the different gods according to their respective
ranks. Thus were at once explained the local theogony and
the present physical features of the island.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Running Amok.</div>

<p>Despite their generally quiet, taciturn demeanour, all these
Sundanese peoples are just as liable as the Orang-Mal&aacute;yu
himself, to those sudden outbursts of demoniacal
frenzy and homicidal mania called by them <i>m&#277;ng-&aacute;mok</i>,
and by us "running amok." Indeed A. R. Wallace
tells us that such wild outbreaks occur more frequently (about
one or two every month) amongst the civilised Mangkassaras
and Bugis of south Celebes than elsewhere in the Archipelago.
"It is the national and therefore the honourable mode of
committing suicide among the natives of Celebes, and is the
fashionable way of escaping from their difficulties. A Roman
fell upon his sword, a Japanese rips up his stomach, and an
Englishman blows out his brains with a pistol. The Bugis
mode has many advantages to one suicidically inclined.
A man thinks himself wronged by society&mdash;he is in debt and
cannot pay&mdash;he is taken for a slave or has gambled away his
wife or child into slavery&mdash;he sees no way of recovering what
he has lost, and becomes desperate. He will not put up with
such cruel wrongs, but will be revenged on mankind and die
like a hero. He grasps his kris-handle, and the next moment
draws out the weapon and stabs a man to the heart. He runs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
on, with bloody kris in his hand, stabbing at everyone he
meets. 'Amok! Amok!' then resounds through the streets.
Spears, krisses, knives and guns are brought out against him.
He rushes madly forward, kills all he can&mdash;men, women, and
children&mdash;and dies overwhelmed by numbers amid all the
excitement of a battle<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The L&aacute;tah
Malady.</div>

<p>Possibly connected with this blind impulse may be the
strange nervous affection called <i>l&aacute;tah</i>, which is also prevalent
amongst the Malayans, and which was first
clearly described by the distinguished Malay
scholar, Sir Frank Athelstane Swettenham<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>. No
attempt has yet been made thoroughly to diagnose this uncanny
disorder<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>, which would seem so much more characteristic of
the high-strung or shattered nervous system of ultra-refined
European society, than of that artless unsophisticated child of
nature, the Orang-Mal&aacute;yu. Its effects on the mental state
are such as to disturb all normal cerebration, and Swettenham
mentions two l&aacute;tah-struck Malays, who would make admirable
"subjects" at a s&eacute;ance of theosophic psychists. Any simple
device served to attract their attention, when by merely
looking them hard in the face they fell helplessly in the
hands of the operator, instantly lost all self-control, and went
passively through any performance either verbally imposed or
even merely suggested by a sign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Malayan
Seafarers and
Rovers.</div>

<p>A peculiar feminine strain has often been imputed to the
Malay temperament, yet this same Oceanic people displays in
many respects a curiously kindred spirit with the ordinary
Englishman, as, for instance, in his love of gambling, boxing,
cock-fighting, field sports<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>, and adventure. No more fearless
explorers of the high seas, formerly rovers and corsairs, at all
times enterprising traders, are anywhere to be found than the
Menangkabau Malays and their near kinsmen,
the renowned Bugis "Merchant Adventurers"
of south Celebes. Their clumsy but seaworthy
praus are met in every seaport from Sumatra to the Aru Islands,
and they have established permanent trading stations and even
settlements in Borneo, the Philippines, Timor, and as far east
as New Guinea. On one occasion Wallace sailed from Dobbo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
in company with fifteen large Makassar praus, each with a cargo
worth about &pound;1000, and as many of the Bugis settle amongst
the rude aborigines of the eastern isles, they thus cooperate
with the Sumatran Malays in extending the area of civilising
influences throughout Papuasia.</p>

<p>Formerly they combined piracy with legitimate trade, and
long after the suppression of the North Bornean corsairs by
Keppel and Brooke, the inland waters continued to be infested
especially by the <i>Bajau</i> rovers of Celebes, and by the <i>Balagnini</i>
of the Sulu Archipelago, most dreaded of all the <i>Orang-Laut</i>,
"Men of the Sea," the "Sea Gypsies" of the English. These
were the "Cellates" (<i>Orang-Selat</i>, "Men of the Straits") of
the early Portuguese writers, who described them as from
time immemorial engaged in fishing and plundering on the
high seas<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Malaysia and
Pelasgia&mdash;a
Historical
Parallel.</div>

<p>In those days, and even in comparatively late times, the
relations in the Eastern Archipelago greatly resembled those
prevailing in the Aegean Sea at the dawn of
Greek history, while the restless seafaring populations
were still in a state of flux, passing from
island to island in quest of booty or barter before
permanently settling down in favourable sites<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>. With the
Greek historian's philosophic disquisition on these Pelasgian
and proto-Hellenic relations may be compared A. R. Wallace's
account of the Batjan coastlands when visited by him in the
late fifties. "Opposite us, and all along this coast of Batchian,
stretches a row of fine islands completely uninhabited. Whenever
I asked the reason why no one goes to live in them, the
answer always was 'For fear of the Magindano pirates<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>.'
Every year these scourges of the Archipelago wander in one
direction or another, making their rendezvous on some
uninhabited island, and carrying devastation to all the small
settlements around; robbing, destroying, killing, or taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
captive all they meet with. Their long, well-manned praus
escape from the pursuit of any sailing vessel by pulling away
right in the wind's eye, and the warning smoke of a steamer
generally enables them to hide in some shallow bay, or narrow
river, or forest-covered inlet, till the danger is passed<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>." Thus,
like geographical surroundings, with corresponding social
conditions, produce like results in all times amongst all
peoples.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Malayan
Folklore&mdash;The
Were-tiger.</div>

<p>This fundamental truth receives further illustration from
the ideas prevalent amongst the Malayans regarding witchcraft,
the magic arts, charms and spells, and
especially the belief in the power of certain
malevolent human beings to transform themselves
into wild beasts and prey upon their fellow-creatures.
Such superstitions girdle the globe, taking their local colouring
from the fauna of the different regions, so that the were-wolf
of medieval Europe finds its counterpart in the human jaguar
of South America, the human lion or leopard of Africa<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>, and
the human tiger of the Malay Peninsula. Hugh Clifford, who
relates an occurrence known to himself in connection with
a "were-tiger" story of the Perak district, aptly remarks that
"the white man and the brown, the yellow and the black,
independently, and without receiving the idea from one
another, have all found the same explanation for the like
phenomena, all apparently recognising the truth of the Malay
proverb, that we are like unto the <i>t&aacute;man</i> fish that preys upon
its own kind<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>." The story in question turns upon a young
bride, whose husband comes home late three nights following,
and the third time, being watched, is discovered by her in the
form of a full-grown tiger stretched on the ladder, which, as in
all Malay houses, leads from the ground to the threshold of
the door. "Pat&iacute;mah gazed at the tiger from a distance of
only a foot or two, for she was too paralysed with fear to
move or cry out, and as she looked a gradual transformation
took place in the creature at her feet. Slowly, as one sees
a ripple of wind pass over the surface of still water, the tiger's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
features palpitated and were changed, until the horrified girl
saw the face of her husband come up through that of the
beast, much as the face of a diver comes up to the surface of
a pool. In another moment Pat&iacute;mah saw that it was Haji Ali
who was ascending the ladder of his house, and the spell that
had hitherto bound her was snapped."</p>

<p>These same Malays of Perak, H. H. Rajah Dris tells us,
are still specially noted for many strange customs and superstitions
"utterly opposed to Muhammadan teaching, and
savouring strongly of devil-worship. This enormous belief
in the supernatural is possibly a relic of the pre-Islam State<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Borneo.</div>

<p>We do not know who were the primitive inhabitants of
Borneo. One would expect to find Negritoes in the interior,
but despite the assertion of A. de Quatrefages<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>
it is impossible to overlook the conclusions of
A. B. Meyer<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> that no authoritative evidence of their occurrence
is forthcoming, and A. C. Haddon<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> confidently states that
there are none in Sarawak. It might be supposed that the
Pre-Dravidian element found in Sumatra and Celebes might
occur also in Borneo, but the only indication of such influence
is the "black skin" noticed among certain Ulu Ayar of the
Upper Kapuas in Western Dutch Borneo<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>. With the exception
of certain peoples such as Europeans, Indians, Chinese,
and Orang-Mal&aacute;yu, whose foreign origin is obvious, the
population as a whole may be regarded as being composed of
two main races, the Indonesian and Proto-Malay. Probably
all tribes are of mixed origin, but some, such as the <i>Murut</i>,
<i>Dusun</i>, <i>Kalabit</i>, and <i>Land Dayak</i> are more Indonesian while
the <i>Iban</i> (<i>Sea Dayak</i>) are distinctly Proto-Malay. The
<i>Land Dayak</i> have doubtless been crossed with Indo-Javans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Punan.</div>

<p>Scattered over a considerable part of the jungle live the
nomad <i>Punan</i> and <i>Ukit</i>. They are a slender pale people
with a slightly broad head. They are grouped
in small communities and inhabit the dense
jungle at the head waters of the principal rivers of Borneo.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
They live on whatever they can find in the jungle, and do not
cultivate the soil, nor live in permanent houses. Their few
wants are supplied by barter from friendly settled peoples, or
in return for iron implements, calico, beads, tobacco, etc., they
offer jungle produce, mainly gutta, indiarubber, camphor,
dammar and ratans. They are very mild savages, not
head-hunters, they are generous to one another, moderately
truthful, kind to the women and very fond of their
children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Klemantan.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Bahau-Kenyah-Kayan.</div>

<p>Hose and Haddon have introduced the term <i>Klemantan</i>
(<i>Kalamantan</i>) for the weak agricultural tribes such as the
<i>Murut</i>, <i>Kalabit</i>, <i>Land Dayak</i>, <i>Sebop</i>, <i>Barawan</i>,
<i>Milanau</i>, etc.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> Brook Low<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>, who knew the
Land Dayak well, gives a very favourable account of the
people and this opinion has been confirmed by other travellers.
They are described as amiable, honest, grateful, moral and
hospitable. Crimes of violence, other than head-hunting, are
unknown. The circular <i>panga</i> is a "house set apart for the
residence of young unmarried men, in which the trophy-heads
are kept, and here also all ceremonial receptions take place<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>."
The <i>baloi</i> of the Ot Danom of the Kahajan river is very
similar<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>. The very energetic and dominating
<i>Bahau-Kenyah-Kayan</i> group are rather short in
stature, with slightly broad heads. They occupy
the best tracts of land which lie in the undulating hills at the
upper reaches of the rivers, between the swampy low country
and the mountains. The Kayan more especially have almost
exterminated some of the smaller tribes. The Klemantan
and Kenyah-Kayan tribes are agriculturalists. They clear
the jungle off the low hills that flank the tributaries of the
larger rivers, but always leave a few scattered trees standing;
irrigation is attempted by the Kalabits only, as <i>padi</i> rice is
grown like any other cereals on dry ground; swamp <i>padi</i> is
also grown on the low land. In their gardens they grow
yams, pumpkins, sugar cane, bananas, and sometimes coconuts
and other produce. They hunt all land animals that serve as
food, and fish, usually with nets, in the rivers, or spear those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
fish that have been stupefied with <i>tuba</i>; river prawns are also
a favourite article of diet.</p>

<p>They all live in long communal houses which are situated
on the banks of the rivers. Among the Klemantan tribes the
headman has not much influence, unless he is a man of
exceptional power and energy, but among the larger tribes
and especially among the Kayan and Kenyah the headmen
are the real chiefs and exercise undisputed sway. The
Kenyah are perhaps the most advanced in social evolution,
holding their own by superior solidarity and intelligence
against the turbulent Kayan.</p>

<p>All the agricultural tribes are artistic, but in varying
degrees; they are also musical and sing delightful chorus
songs. In some tribes the ends of the beams of the houses
are carved to represent various animals, in some the verandah
is decorated with boldly carved planks, or with painted boards
and doors. The bamboo receptacles carved in low relief, the
bone handles of their swords and the minor articles of daily life,
are decorated in a way that reveals the true artistic spirit.
Both Kenyah and Kayan smelt iron and make spear heads
and sword blades, the former being especially noted for their
good steel. The forge with two bellows is the form widely
spread in Malaysia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Iban
(Sea Dayak).</div>

<p>The truculent <i>Iban</i> (<i>Sea Dayak</i>) have spread from a
restricted area in Sarawak<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>.  They are short and have
broader heads than the other tribes; the colour
is on the whole darker than among the cinnamon
coloured inland tribes. They have the same
long, slightly wavy, black hair showing a reddish tinge in
certain lights, that is characteristic of the Borneans generally.
Most of the Iban inhabit low lying land; they prefer to live
on the low hills, but as this is not always practicable they
plant swamp <i>padi</i>; all those who settle at the heads of
rivers plant <i>padi</i> on the hills in the same manner as the
up-river natives. They also cultivate maize, sugar cane,
sweet potatoes, gourds, pumpkins, cucumbers, melons, mustard,
ginger and other vegetables. Generally groups of relations
work together in the fields. Although essentially agricultural,
they are warlike and passionately devoted to head-hunting.
The Iban of the Batang Lupar and Saribas in the olden days
joined the Malays in their large war praus on piratical raids<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
along the coast and up certain rivers and they owe their name
of Sea Dayaks to this practice. The raids were organised by
Malays who went for plunder but they could always ensure
the aid of Iban by the bribe of the heads of the slain as their
share. The Iban women weave beautiful cotton cloths on
a very simple loom. Intricate patterns are made by tying
several warp strands with leaves at varying intervals, then
dipping the whole into the dye which does not penetrate the
tied portions. This process is repeated if a three-colour
design is desired. The pattern is produced solely in the warp,
the woof threads are self-coloured and are not visible in the
fabric, which is therefore a cotton rep. Little tattooing is
seen among the Iban women though the men have adopted
the custom from the Kayan.</p>

<p>It is probable that the Iban belong to the same stock as
the original Malay and if so, their migration may be regarded
as the first wave of the movement that culminated in the
Malay Empire. The Malays must have come to Borneo not
later than the early part of the fifteenth century as Brunei was
a large and wealthy town in 1521. Probably the Malays
came directly from the Malay Peninsula, but they must have
mixed largely with the <i>Kadayan</i>, <i>Milanau</i> and other coastal
people. The Sarawak and Brunei Malays are probably
mainly coastal Borneans with some Malay blood, but they
have absorbed the Malay culture, spirit and religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary.</div>

<p>From the sociological point of view the Punan, living by
the chase and on exploitation of jungle produce, represent the
lowest grade of culture in Borneo. Without
social organisation they are alike incapable of real
endemic improvement or of seriously affecting other peoples.
The purely agricultural tribes that cultivate <i>padi</i> on the low
hills or in the swamps form the next social stratum. These
indigenous tillers of the soil have been hard pressed by various
swarms of foreigners.</p>

<p>The Kenyah-Kayan migration was that of a people of
a slightly higher grade of culture. They were agriculturalists,
but the social organisation was firmer and they were probably
superior in physique. If they introduced iron weapons, this
would give them an enormous advantage. These immigrant
agricultural artisans, directed by powerful chiefs, had no
difficulty in taking possession of the most desirable land.</p>

<p>From an opposite point of the compass in early times<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
came another agricultural people who strangely enough have
strong individualistic tendencies, the usually peaceable habits
of tillers of the soil having been complicated by a lust for
heads and other warlike propensities. But the Iban do not
appear to have gained much against the Kenyah and Kayan.
Conquest implies a strong leader, obedience to authority and
concerted action. The Iban appear to be formidable only
when led and organised by Europeans.</p>

<p>The Malay was of a yet higher social type. His political
organisation was well established, and he had the advantage
of religious enthusiasm, for Islam has no small share in the
expansion of the Malay. He is a trader, and still more an
exploiter, having a sporting element in his character not
altogether compatible with steady trade. Then appeared on
the scene the Anglo-Saxon overlord. The quality of firmness
combined with justice made itself felt. At times the lower
social types hurled themselves, but in vain, against the
instrument that had been forged and tempered in a similar
turmoil of Iberian, Celt, Angle and Viking in Northern
Europe. Now they acknowledge that safety of life and
property and almost complete liberty are fully worth the very
small price that they have to pay for them<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion.</div>

<p>The cult of omen animals, most frequently birds, is
indigenous to Borneo. These are possessed with the spirit
of certain invisible beings above, and bear their
names, and are invoked to secure good crops,
freedom from accident, victory in war, profit in exchange,
skill in discourse and cleverness in all native craft. The
Iban have a belief in <i>Ngarong</i> or spirit-helpers, somewhat
resembling that of the <i>Manitu</i> of North America. The
<i>Ngarong</i> is the spirit of a dead relative who visits a dreamer,
who afterwards searches for the outward and visible sign of
his spiritual protector, and finds it in some form, perhaps
a natural object, or some one animal, henceforth held in
special respect<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>as well as other mysterious monuments in the Passumah lands
inland from Benkulen, relics of a former culture, which goes
back to prehistoric times. They take the form
of huge monoliths, which are roughly shaped to
the likeness of human figures, with strange
features very different from the Malay or Hindu types. The
present Sarawi natives of the district, who would be quite
incapable of executing such works, know nothing of their
origin, and attribute them to certain legendary beings who
formerly wandered over the land, turning all their enemies
into stone. Further research may possibly discover some
connection between these relics of a forgotten past and the
numerous prehistoric monuments of Easter Island and other
places in the Pacific Ocean. Of all the Indonesian peoples
still surviving in Malaysia, none present so many
points of contact with the Eastern Polynesians,
as do the natives of the Mentawi Islands which
skirt the south-west coast of Sumatra. "On a closer inspection
of the inhabitants the attentive observer at once perceives that
the Mentawi natives have but little in common with the peoples
and tribes of the neighbouring islands, and that as regards
physical appearance, speech, customs, and usages they stand
almost entirely apart. They bear such a decided stamp of
a Polynesian tribe that one feels far more inclined to compare
them with the inhabitants of the South Sea Islands<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Javanese and
Hindu
Influences.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Indian Origin of
the Malaysian
Alphabets.</div>

<p>The survival of an Indonesian group on the western
verge of Malaysia is all the more remarkable since the <i>Nias</i>
islanders, a little farther north, are of Mongol stock, like most
if not all of the inhabitants of the Sumatran mainland. Here
the typical Malays of the central districts (Menangkabau,
Korinchi, and Siak) merge southwards in the
mixed Malayo-Javanese peoples of the <i>Rejang</i>,
<i>Palembang</i>, and <i>Lampong</i> districts. Although
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>Muhammadans probably since the thirteenth century, all these
peoples had been early brought under Hindu influences by
missionaries and even settlers from Java, and these influences
are still apparent in many of the customs, popular traditions,
languages, and letters of the South Sumatran settled communities.
Thus the Lampongs, despite their profession of
Islam, employ, not the Arabic characters, like
the Malays proper, but a script derived from the
peculiar Javanese writing system. This system
itself, originally introduced from India probably over 2000 years
ago, is based on some early forms of the Devanagari, such as
those occurring in the rock inscriptions of the famous Buddhist
king As'oka (third century <small>B.C.</small>)<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>. From Java, which is now
shown beyond doubt to be the true centre of dispersion<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>, the
parent alphabet was under Hindu influences diffused in pre-Muhammadan
times throughout Malaysia, from Sumatra to
the Philippines.</p>

<p>But the thinly-spread Indo-Javanese culture, in few places
penetrating much below the surface, received a rude shock
from the Muhammadan irruption, its natural development
being almost everywhere arrested, or else either effaced or
displaced by Islam. No trace can any longer be detected of
graphic signs in Borneo, where the aborigines have retained
the savage state even in those southern districts where
Buddhism or Brahmanism had certainly been propagated
long before the arrival of the Muhammadan Malays. But
elsewhere the Javanese stock alphabet has shown extraordinary
vitality, persisting under diverse forms down to the present
day, not only amongst the semi-civilised Mussulman peoples,
such as the Sumatran Rejangs<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>, Korinchi, and Lampongs, the
Bugis and Mangkassaras of Celebes, and the (now Christian)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
Tagalogs and Visayas of the Philippines, but even amongst
the somewhat rude and pagan Palawan natives, the wild
Manguianes of Mindoro, and the cannibal Battas<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> of North
Sumatra.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Battas&mdash;Cultured
Cannibals.</div>

<p>These Battas, however, despite their undoubted cannibalism<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>,
cannot be called savages, at least without some
reserve. They are skilful stock-breeders and
agriculturists, raising fine crops of maize and
rice; they dwell together in large, settled
communities with an organised government, hereditary chiefs,
popular assemblies, and a written civil and penal code. There
is even an effective postal system, which utilises for letter-boxes
the hollow tree-trunks at all the cross-roads, and is
largely patronised by the young men and women, all of
whom read and write, and carry on an animated correspondence
in their degraded Devanagari script, which is written on
palm-leaves in vertical lines running upwards and from right
to left. The Battas also excel in several industries, such as
pottery, weaving, jewellery, iron work, and house-building,
their picturesque dwellings, which resemble Swiss chalets,
rising to two stories above the ground-floor reserved for the
live stock. For these arts they are no doubt largely indebted
to their Hindu teachers, from whom also they have inherited
some of their religious ideas, such as the triune deity&mdash;Creator,
Preserver, and Destroyer&mdash;besides other inferior divinities
collectively called <i>diebata</i>, a modified form of the Indian
<i>devat&eacute;</i><a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cannibalism.</div>

<p>In the strangest contrast to these survivals of a foreign
culture which had probably never struck very deep roots,
stand the savage survivals from still more ancient times.
Conspicuous amongst these are the cannibal practices, which
if not now universal still take some peculiarly revolting forms.
Thus captives and criminals are, under certain circumstances,
condemned to be eaten alive, and the same fate
is or was reserved for those incapacitated for
work by age or infirmities. When the time came, we are
told by the early European observers and by the reports of
the Arabs, the "grandfathers" voluntarily suspended themselves
by their arms from an overhanging branch, while friends
and neighbours danced round and round, shouting, "when the
fruit is ripe it falls." And when it did fall, that is, as soon as
it could hold on no longer, the company fell upon it with their
krisses, hacking it to pieces, and devouring the remains
seasoned with lime-juice, for such feasts were generally held
when the limes were ripe<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Achinese.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Early Records.</div>

<p>Grouped chiefly round about Lake Toba, the Battas occupy
a very wide domain, stretching south to about the parallel of
Mount Ophir, and bordering northwards on the
territory of the Achin people. These valiant
natives, who have till recently stoutly maintained their
political independence against the Dutch, were also at one
time Hinduized, as is evident from many of their traditions,
their Malayan language largely charged with Sanskrit terms,
and even their physical appearance, suggesting a considerable
admixture of Hindu as well as of Arab blood.
With the Arab traders and settlers came the
Koran, and the Achinese people have been not over-zealous
followers of the Prophet since the close of the twelfth century.
The Muhammadan State, founded in 1205, acquired a
dominant position in the Archipelago early in the sixteenth
century, when it ruled over about half of Sumatra, exacted
tribute from many vassal princes, maintained powerful armaments
by land and sea, and entered into political and
commercial relations with Egypt, Japan, and several European
States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Islam and
Hindu Reminiscences.</div>

<p>There are two somewhat distinct ethnical groups, the
<i>Orang-Tunong</i> of the uplands, a comparatively homogeneous
Malayan people, and the mixed <i>Orang-Baruh</i> of the lowlands,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>who are described by A. Lubbers<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> as taller than the average
Malay (5 feet 5 or 6 in.), also less round-headed (index 80.5),
with prominent nose, rather regular features, and muscular
frames; but the complexion is darker than that of the Orang-Mal&aacute;yu,
a trait which has been attributed to a larger infusion
of Dravidian blood (Klings and Tamuls) from southern India.
The charge of cruelty and treachery brought against them by
the Dutch may be received with some reserve, such terms as
"patriot" and "rebel" being interchangeable according to
the standpoints from which they are considered. In any case
no one denies them the virtues of valour and love of freedom,
with which are associated industrious habits and a remarkable
aptitude for such handicrafts as metal work, jewellery, weaving,
and ship-building. The Achinese do not appear to be very
strict Muhammadans; polygamy is little practised,
their women are free to go abroad unveiled, nor
are they condemned to the seclusion of the harem,
and a pleasing survival from Buddhist times is the <i>Kanduri</i>,
a solemn feast, in which the poor are permitted to share.
Another reminiscence of Hindu philosophy may perhaps have
been an outburst of religious fervour, which took the form of
a pantheistic creed, and was so zealously preached, that it had
to be stamped out with fire and sword by the dominant
Moslem monotheists<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethnical
Relations in
Madagascar.</div>

<p>Since the French occupation of Madagascar, the Malagasy
problem has naturally been revived.  But it may
be regretted that so much time and talent have
been spent on a somewhat thrashed-out question
by a number of writers, who did not first take the trouble to
read up the literature of the subject.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prehistoric
Peoples.</div>

<p>By what race Madagascar was first peopled it is no longer
possible to say. The local reports or traditions of primitive
peoples, either extinct or still surviving in the
interior, belong rather to the sphere of Malagasy
folklore than to that of ethnological research.
In these reports mention is frequently made of the <i>Kimos</i>,
said to be now or formerly living in the Bara country, and of
the <i>Vazimbas</i>, who are by some supposed to have been Gallas
(<i>Ba-Simba</i>)&mdash;though they had no knowledge of iron&mdash;whose
graves are supposed to be certain monolithic monuments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
which take the form of menhirs disposed in circles, and are
believed by the present inhabitants of the land to be still
haunted by evil spirits, that is, the ghosts of the long extinct
Vazimbas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oceanic
Immigrants.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Negroid
Element.</div>

<p>Much of the confusion prevalent regarding the present
ethnical relations may be avoided if certain points (ably
summarised by T. A. Joyce<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>) are borne in mind.
The greater part of the population is negroid;
the language spoken over the whole of the
island and many institutions and customs are Malayo-Polynesian.
A small section (Antimerina commonly called
Hovas)&mdash;forming the dominant people in the nineteenth
century&mdash;is of fairly pure Malay (or Javanese) blood, but is
composed of sixteenth-century immigrants, whereas the
language belongs to a very early branch of the Malayo-Polynesian
(Austronesian) family. It would be natural to
suppose that the negroid element was African<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>,
for in later times large numbers of Africans
have been brought over by Arabs and other
slavers; but there are several objections to this view. In
the first place, the natives of the neighbouring coast are not
seamen, and the voyage to Madagascar offers peculiar
difficulties owing to the strong currents. In the second place,
it seems impossible that the first inhabitants, supposing them
to be African, should have abandoned their own language
in favour of one introduced by a small minority of immigrants;
the few Bantu words found in Madagascar may well have
been adopted from the slaves. In the third place, the culture
exhibits no distinctively African features, but is far more akin
to that of south-east Asia. There is much to be said, therefore,
for the view that the earliest and negroid inhabitants of
Madagascar were Oceanic negroids, who have always been
known as expert seamen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arabic Element.</div>

<p>Since the coming of the negroid population, which probably
arrived in very early days, various small bands of immigrants
or castaways have landed on the shores of Madagascar and
imposed themselves as reigning dynasties on the surrounding
villages, each thus forming the nucleus of what now appears
as a tribe. Among these were immigrants from Arabia, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>J. T. Last, who identifies Madagascar with the island of
<i>Menuthias</i> described by Arrian in the third
century <small>A.D.</small><a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>, suggests the "possibility that
Madagascar may have been reached by Arabs before the
Christian era." This "possibility" is converted almost into
a certainty by the analysis of the Arabo-Malagasy terms
made by Dahle, who clearly shows that such terms "are
comparatively very few," and also "very ancient," in fact that,
as already suggested by Fleischer of Leipzig, many, perhaps
the majority of them, "may be traced back to Himyaritic
influence<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>," that is, not merely to pre-Muhammadan, but to
pre-Christian times, just like the Sanskritic elements in the
Oceanic tongues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Uniformity of
the Language.</div>

<p>The evidence that Malagasy is itself one of these Oceanic
tongues, and not an offshoot of the comparatively recent
standard Malay is overwhelming, and need not
here detain us<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>. The diffusion of this Austronesian
language over the whole island&mdash;even
amongst distinctly Negroid Bantu populations, such as the
Betsileos and Tanalas&mdash;to the absolute exclusion of all other
forms of speech, is an extraordinary linguistic phenomenon
more easily proved than explained. There are, of course,
provincialisms and even what may be called local dialects,
such as that of the Antankarana people at the northern
extremity of the island who, although commonly included in
the large division of the western Sakalavas, really form
a separate ethnical group, speaking a somewhat marked
variety of Malagasy. But even this differs much less from
the normal form than might be supposed by comparing, for
instance, such a term as <i>maso-mahamay</i>, sun, with the Hova
<i>maso-andro</i>, where <i>maso</i> in both means "eye," <i>mahamay</i> in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
both = "burning," and <i>andro</i> in both = "day." Thus the
only difference is that one calls the sun "burning eye," while
the Hovas call it the "day's eye," as do so many peoples in
Malaysia<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Malagasy
Gothamites.</div>

<p>So also the fish-eating <i>Anorohoro</i> people, a branch of the
<i>Sihanakas</i> in the Alaotra valley, are said to have "quite
a different dialect from them<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>." But the statement
need not be taken too seriously, because
these rustic fisherfolk, who may be called the
Gothamites of Madagascar, are supposed, by their scornful
neighbours, to do everything "contrariwise." Of them it is
told that once when cooking eggs they boiled them for hours
to make them soft, and then finding they got harder and
harder threw them away as unfit for food. Others having
only one slave, who could not paddle the canoe properly, cut
him in two, putting one half at the prow, the other at the
stern, and were surprised at the result. It was not to be expected
that such simpletons should speak Malagasy properly,
which nevertheless is spoken with surprising uniformity by all
the Malayan and Negro or Negroid peoples alike.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Partial Fusion
of the Malayan
and Negro
Races.</div>

<p>In Madagascar, however, the fusion of the two races is
far less complete than is commonly supposed. Various shades
of transition between the two extremes are no
doubt presented by the <i>Sakalavas</i> of the west,
and the <i>Betsimisarakas</i>, <i>Sitanakas</i>, and others
of the east coast. But, strange to say, on the
central tableland the two seem to stand almost completely
apart, so that here the politically dominant Hovas still present
all the essential characteristics of the Oceanic Mongol, while
their southern neighbours, the <i>Betsileos</i>, as well as the <i>Tanalas</i>
and <i>Ibaras</i>, are described as "African pure and simple, allied
to the south-eastern tribes of that continent<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>."</p>

<p>Specially remarkable is the account given by a careful
observer, G. A. Shaw, of the Betsileos, whose "average
height is not less than six feet for the men, and a few inches
less for the women. They are large-boned and muscular, and
their colour is several degrees darker than that of the Hovas,
approaching very close to a black. The forehead is low and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
broad, the nose flatter, and the lips thicker than those of their
conquerors, whilst their hair is <i>invariably</i> crisp and woolly.
No pure Betsileo is to be met with having the smooth long
hair of the Hovas. In this, as in other points, there is a very
clear departure from the Malayan type, and a close approximation
to the Negro races of the adjacent continent<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hova Type.</div>

<p>Now compare these brawny negroid giants with the wiry
undersized Malayan Hovas. As described by A. Vouchereau<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>,
their type closely resembles that of the Javanese&mdash;short
stature, yellowish or light leather complexion,
long, black, smooth and rather coarse hair, round
head (85.25), flat and straight forehead, flat face, prominent
cheek-bones, small straight nose, tolerably wide nostrils, small
black and slightly oblique eyes, rather thick lips, slim lithesome
figure, small extremities, dull restless expression, cranial
capacity 1516 c.c., superior to both Negro and Sakalava<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Black
Element from
Africa.</div>

<p>Except in respect of this high cranial capacity, the measurements
of three Malagasy skulls in the Cambridge University
Anatomical Museum, studied by W. L. H. Duckworth<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>,
correspond fairly well with these descriptions. Thus the
cephalic index of the reputed Betsimisaraka (Negroid) and
that of the Betsileo (Negro) are respectively 71 and 72.4,
while that of the Hova is 82.1; the first two, therefore, are
long-headed, the third round-headed, as we should expect.
But the cubic capacity of the Hova (presumably Mongoloid)
is only 1315 as compared with 1450 and 1480
of two others, presumably African Negroes.
Duckworth discusses the question whether the
black element in Madagascar is of African or Oceanic (Melanesian-Papuan)
origin, about which much diversity of opinion
still prevails, and on the evidence of the few cranial specimens
available he decides in favour of the African.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mental
Qualities of
the Malagasy.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Spread of
Christianity.</div>

<p>Despite the low cubic capacity of Duckworth's Hova,
the mental powers of these, and indeed of the Malagasy
generally, are far from despicable. Before the
French occupation the London Missionary
Society had succeeded in disseminating Christian
principles and even some degree of culture among considerable
numbers both in the Hova capital and surrounding districts.
The local press had been kept going by native
compositors who had issued quite an extensive
literature both in Malagasy and English. Agricultural
and industrial methods had been improved, some
engineering works attempted, and the Hova craftsmen had
learnt to build but not to complete houses in the European
style, because, although they could master European processes,
they could not, Christians though they were, get the better
of the old superstitions, one of which is that the owner of a
house always dies within a year of its completion. Longevity
is therefore ensured by not completing it, with the curious
result that the whole city looks unfinished or dilapidated. In
the house where Mrs Colvile stayed, "one window was
framed and glazed, the other nailed up with rough boards;
part of the stair-banister had no top-rail; outside only a portion
of the roof had been tiled; and so on throughout<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Culture.</div>

<p>The culture has been thus summarised by T. A. Joyce<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>.
Clothing is entirely vegetable, and the Malay <i>sarong</i> is found
throughout the east; bark-cloth in the south-east
and west. Hairdressing varies considerably, and
among the Bara and Sakalava is often elaborate. Silver
ornaments are found amongst the Antimerina and some other
eastern tribes, made chiefly from European coins dating from
the sixteenth century. Circumcision is universal. In the
east the tribes are chiefly agricultural; in the north, west and
south, pastoral. Fishing is important among those tribes
situated on coast, lake or river. Houses are all rectangular
and pile-dwellings are found locally. Rice is the staple crop
and the cattle are of the humped variety. The Antimerina
excel the rest in all crafts. Weaving, basket-work (woven
variety) and iron-working are all good; the use of iron is said
to have been unknown to the Bara and Vazimba until comparatively
recent times. Pottery is poor. Carvings in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>round (men and animals) are found amongst the Sakalava
and Bara, in relief (arabesques, etc.) among the Betsileo and
others. Before the introduction of firearms, the spear was
the universal weapon; bows are rare and possibly of late
introduction; slings and the blowgun are also found. Shields
are circular, made of wood covered with hide. The early
system of government was patriarchal, and villages were
independent; the later immigrants introduced a system of
feudal monarchy with themselves as a ruling caste. Thus
the Antimerina have three main castes; <i>Andriana</i> or nobles
(<i>i.e.</i> pure-blooded descendants of the conquerors), <i>Hova</i>, or
freemen (descendants of the incorporated Vazimba more or
less mixed with the conquerors), and <i>Andevo</i> or slaves. The
king was regarded almost as a god. An institution thoroughly
suggestive of Malayo-Polynesian sociology is that of <i>fadi</i> or
tabu, which enters into every sphere of human activity. An
indefinite creator-god was recognized, but more important
were a number of spirits and fetishes, the latter with definite
functions. Signs of tree worship and of belief in transmigration
are sporadic. At the present time, half the population of the
island is, at least nominally, Christian.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Malagasy
Folklore.</div>

<p>A good deal of fancy is displayed in the oral literature,
comprising histories, or at least legends, fables, songs, riddles,
and a great mass of folklore, much of which has
already been rescued from oblivion by the
"Malagasy Folklore Society."  Some of the
stories present the usual analogies to others in widely separated
lands, stories which seem to be perennial, and to crop up
wherever the surface is a little disturbed by investigators.
One of those in Dahle's extensive collection, entitled the
"History of Andrianarisainaboniamasoboniamanoro" might
be described as a variant of our "Beauty and the Beast."
Besides this prince with the long name, called <i>Bonia</i> "for
short," there is a princess "Golden Beauty," both being of
miraculous birth, but the latter a cripple and deformed, until
found and wedded by Bonia. Then she is so transfigured that
the "Beast" is captivated and contrives to carry her off.
Thereupon follows an extraordinary series of adventures,
resulting of course in the rescue of Golden Beauty by Bonia,
when everything ends happily, not only for the two lovers,
but for all other people whose wives had also been abducted.
These are now restored to their husbands by the hero, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>vanquishes and slays the monster in a fierce fight, just as in
our nursery tales of knights and dragons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Philippine
Natives.</div>

<p>In the Philippines, where the ethnical confusion is probably
greater than in any other part of Malaysia, the great bulk of
the inhabitants appear to be of Indonesian and
proto-Malayan stocks. Except in the southern
island of Mindanao, which is still mainly Muhammadan
or heathen, most of the settled populations have long
been nominal Roman Catholics under a curious theocratic
administration, in which the true rulers are not the civil
functionaries, but the priests, and especially the regular clergy<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>.
One result has been over three centuries of unstable political
and social relations, ending in the occupation of the archipelago
by the United States (1898). Another, with which we are
here more concerned, has been such a transformation of the
subtle Malayan character that those who have lived longest
amongst the natives pronounce their temperament unfathomable.
Having to comply outwardly with the numerous
Christian observances, they seek relief in two ways, first by
making the most of the Catholic ceremonial and turning the
many feast-days of the calendar into occasions of revelry and
dissipation, connived at if not even shared in by the padres<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>;
secondly by secretly cherishing the old beliefs and disguising
their true feelings, until the opportunity is presented of
throwing off the mask and declaring themselves in their true
colours.  A Franciscan friar, who had spent half his life
amongst them, left on record that "the native is an incomprehensible
phenomenon, the mainspring of whose line of
thought and the guiding motive of whose actions have never
yet been, and perhaps never will be, discovered. A native
will serve a master satisfactorily for years, and then suddenly
abscond, or commit some such hideous crime as conniving
with a brigand band to murder the family and pillage the
house<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>."</p>

<p>In fact nobody can ever tell what a Tagal, and especially
a Visaya, will do at any moment. His character is a
succession of surprises; "the experience of each year brings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
one to form fresh conclusions, and the most exact definition
of such a kaleidoscopic creature is, after all, hypothetical."</p>

<p>After centuries of misrule, it was perhaps not surprising
that no kind of sympathy was developed between the natives
and the whites. Foreman fells us that everywhere in the
archipelago he found mothers teaching their little ones to
look on their white rulers as demoniacal beings, evil spirits,
or at least something to be dreaded. "If a child cries, it is
hushed by the exclamation, <i>Castila!</i> (Spaniard); if a white
man approaches a native dwelling, the watchword always is
<i>Castila!</i> and the children hasten to retreat from the dreadful
object."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Three Social
Groups.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Indios.</div>

<p>For administrative purposes the natives were classed
in three social divisions&mdash;<i>Indios</i>, <i>Infieles</i>, and <i>Moros</i>&mdash;which,
as aptly remarked by F. H. H. Guillemard,
is "an ecclesiastical rather than a scientific
classification<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>." The <i>Indios</i> were the Christianized
and more or less cultured populations of all the towns
and of the settled agricultural districts, speaking
a distinct Malayo-Polynesian language of much
more archaic type than the standard Malay. According to
the census of 1903 the total population of the islands was
7,635,428, of whom nearly 7,000,000 were classed as civilised,
and the rest as wild, including 23,000 Negritoes (<i>Aeta</i>, see
p. 156). At the time of the Spanish occupation in the sixteenth
century the <i>Visayas</i> of the central islands and part of
Mindanao were the most advanced among the native tribes,
but this distinction is now claimed for the <i>Tagalogs</i>, who form
the bulk of the population in Manila and other parts of Luzon,
and also in Mindanao, and whose language is gradually
displacing other dialects throughout the archipelago. Other
civilised tribes are the <i>Ilocano</i>, <i>Bicol</i>, <i>Pangasinan</i>, <i>Pampangan</i>
and <i>Cagayan</i>, all of Luzon. Less civilised tribes are the
<i>Manobo</i>, <i>Mandaya</i>, <i>Subano</i> and <i>Bagobo</i> of Mindanao, the
<i>Bukidnon</i> of Mindanao and the central islands, the <i>Tagbanua</i>
and <i>Batak</i> of Palawan, and the <i>Igorots</i> of Luzon, some of
whom are industrious farmers, while among others, head-hunting
is still prevalent. These have been described by
A. E. Jenks in a monograph<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>. The head form is very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
variable. Of 32 men measured by Jenks the extremes of
cephalic index were 91.48 and 67.48. The stature is always
low, averaging 1.62 m. (5 ft. 4 in.) but with an appearance of
greater height. The hair is black, straight, lank, coarse and
abundant but "I doubt whether to-day an entire tribe of
perfectly straight-haired primitive Malayan people exists in
the archipelago<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Moros.</div>

<p>Under <i>Moros</i> ("Moors") are comprised the Muhammadans
exclusively, some of whom are Malayans (chiefly in Mindanao,
Basilan, and Palawan), some true Malays (chiefly
in the Sulu archipelago). Many of these are
still independent, and not a few, if not actually wild, are
certainly but little removed from the savage state. Yet, like
the Sumatran Battas, they possess a knowledge of letters, the
Sulu people using the Arabic script, as do all the Orang-Mal&aacute;yu,
while the Palawan natives employ a variant of the
Devanagari prototype derived directly from the Javanese, as
above explained. They number nearly 280,000, of whom
more than one half are in Mindanao, and they form the bulk
of the population in some of the islands of the Sulu archipelago.</p>

<p>Some of these Sulu people, till lately fierce sea-rovers, get
baptized now and then; but, says Foreman, "they appeared
to be as much Christian as I was Mussulman<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>." They keep
their harems all the same, and when asked how many gods
there are, answer "four," presumably Allah plus the Athanasian
Trinity. So the Ba-Fiots of Angola add crucifying to their
"penal code," and so in King M'tesa's time the Baganda
scrupulously kept two weekly holidays, the Mussulman Friday,
and the Christian Sunday. Lofty creeds superimposed too
rapidly on primitive beliefs are apt to get "mixed"; they
need time to become assimilated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Malayans and
Indonesians
in Formosa.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Chinese
Settlers.</div>

<p>That in the aborigines of Formosa are represented both
Mongol (proto-Malayan) and Indonesian elements may now
probably be accepted as an established fact. The long-standing
reports of Negritoes also, like the
Philippine Aeta, have never been confirmed,
and may be dismissed from the present consideration.
Probably five-sixths of the whole population are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>Chinese immigrants, amongst whom are a large number of
Hakkas and Hok-los from the provinces of Fo-Kien
and Kwang-tung<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>. They occupy all the
cultivated western lowlands, which from the
ethnological standpoint may be regarded as a seaward outpost
of the Chinese mainland. The rest of the island, that is, the
central highlands and precipitous eastern slopes, may similarly
be looked on as a north-eastern outpost of Malaysia, being
almost exclusively held by Indonesian and Malayan aborigines
from Malaysia (especially the Philippines), with possibly some
early intruders both from Polynesia and from the north
(Japan). All are classed by the Chinese settlers after their
usual fashion in three social divisions:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The <i>Pepohwans</i> of the plains, who although called
"Barbarians," are sedentary agriculturists and quite as civilised
as their Chinese neighbours themselves, with whom they are
gradually merging in a single ethnical group. The Pepohwans
are described by P. Ibis as a fine race, very tall, and "fetishists,"
though the mysterious rites are left to the women. Their
national feasts, dances, and other usages forcibly recall those
of the Micronesians and Polynesians. They may therefore,
perhaps, be regarded as early immigrants from the South Sea
Islands, distinct in every respect from the true aborigines.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Sekhwans</i>, "Tame Savages<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>," who are also settled
agriculturists, subject to the Chinese (since 1895 to the
Japanese) administration, but physically distinct from all the
other Formosans&mdash;light complexion, large mouth, thick lips,
remarkably long and prominent teeth, weak constitution.
P. Ibis suspects a strain of Dutch blood dating from the
seventeenth century. This is confirmed by the old books and
other curious documents found amongst them, which have given
rise to so much speculation, and, it may be added, some
mystification, regarding a peculiar writing system and a
literature formerly current amongst the Formosan
aborigines<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The <i>Chinhwans</i>, "Green Barbarians"&mdash;that is, utter
savages&mdash;the true independent aborigines, of whom there are
an unknown number of tribes, but regarding whom the Chinese
possess but little definite information. Not so their Japanese
successors, one of whom, Kisak Tamai<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>, tells us that the
Chinhwans show a close resemblance to the Malays of the
Malay Peninsula and also to those of the Philippines, and in
some respects to the Japanese themselves. When dressed
like Japanese and mingling with Japanese women, they can
hardly be distinguished from them. The vendetta is still rife
amongst many of the ruder tribes, and such is their traditional
hatred of the Chinese intruders that no one can either be
tattooed or permitted to wear a bracelet until he has carried
off a Celestial head or two. In every household there is a
frame or bracket on which these heads are mounted, and
some of their warriors can proudly point to over seventy of
such trophies. It is a relief to hear that with their new
Japanese masters they have sworn friendship, these new rulers
of the land being their "brothers and sisters." The oath of
eternal alliance is taken by digging a hole in the ground,
putting a stone in it, throwing earth at each other, then
covering the stone with the earth, all of which means that
"as the stone in the ground keeps sound, so do we keep our
word unbroken."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Racial
Affinities.</div>

<p>It is interesting to note that this Japanese ethnologist's
remarks on the physical resemblances of the aborigines are
fully in accord with those of European observers.
Thus to Hamy "they recalled the Igorrotes of
North Luzon, as well as the Malays of Singapore<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>."
G. Taylor also, who has visited several of the wildest
groups in the southern and eastern districts<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> (<i>Tipuns</i>, <i>Paiwans</i>,
<i>Diaramocks</i>, <i>Nickas</i>, <i>Amias</i> and many others), traces some
"probably" to Japan (Tipuns); others to Malaysia (the cruel,
predatory Paiwan head-hunters); and others to the Liu-Kiu
archipelago (the Pepohwans now of Chinese speech). He
describes the Diaramocks as the most dreaded of all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
southern groups, but doubts whether the charge of cannibalism
brought against them by their neighbours is quite
justified.</p>

<p>Whether the historical Malays from Singapore or elsewhere,
as above suggested, are really represented in Formosa
may be doubted, since no survivals either of Hindu or
Muhammadan rites appear to have been detected amongst
the aborigines. It is of course possible that they may have
reached the island at some remote time, and since relapsed
into savagery, from which the Orang-laut were never very
far removed. But in the absence of proof, it will be safer to
regard all the wild tribes as partly of Indonesian, partly of
proto-Malayan origin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Linguistic
Affinities.</div>

<p>This view is also in conformity with the character of the
numerous Formosan dialects, whose affinities are either with
the Gyarung and others of the Asiatic Indonesian
tongues, or else with the Austronesian organic
speech generally, but not specially with any
particular member of that family, least of all with the comparatively
recent standard Malay. Thus Arnold Schetelig
points out that only about a sixth part of the Formosan
vocabulary taken generally corresponds with modern Malay<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>.
The analogies of all the rest must be sought in the various
branches of the Oceanic stock language, and in the Gyarung
and the non-Chinese tongues of Eastern China<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>. Formosa
thus presents a curious ethnical and linguistic connecting link
between the Continental and Oceanic populations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Nicobarese.</div>

<p>In the Nicobar archipelago are distinguished two ethnical
groups, the coast people, <i>i.e.</i> the <i>Nicobarese</i><a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> proper, and the
<i>Shom Pen</i>, aborigines of the less accessible inland
districts in Great Nicobar. But the distinction
appears to be rather social than racial, and we
may now conclude with E. H. Man that all the islanders
belong essentially to the Mongolic division, the inlanders
representing the pure type, the others being "descended from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
a mongrel Malay stock, the crosses being probably in the
majority of cases with Burmese and occasionally with natives
of the opposite coast of Siam, and perchance also in remote
times with such of the Shom Pen as may have settled in
their midst<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>."</p>

<p>Among the numerous usages which point to an Indo-Chinese
and Oceanic connection are pile-dwellings; the
chewing of betel, which appears to be here mixed with some
earthy substance causing a dental incrustation so thick as even
to prevent the closing of the lips; distention of the ear-lobe
by wooden cylinders; aversion from the use of milk; and the
<i>couvade</i>, as amongst some Bornean Dayaks. The language,
which has an extraordinarily rich phonetic system (as many
as 25 consonantal and 35 vowel sounds), is polysyllabic and
untoned, like the Austronesian, and the type also seems to
resemble the Oceanic more than the Continental Mongol
subdivision. Mean height 5 ft. 3 in. (Shom Pen one inch
less); nose wide and flat; eyes rather obliquely set; cheekbones
prominent; features flat, though less so than in the
normal Malayan; complexion mostly a yellowish or reddish
brown (Shom Pen dull brown); hair a dark rusty brown,
rarely quite black, straight, though not seldom wavy and even
ringletty, but Shom Pen generally quite straight.</p>

<p>On the other hand they approach nearer to the Burmese
in their mental characters; in their frank, independent spirit,
inquisitiveness, and kindness towards their women, who enjoy
complete social equality, as in Burma; and lastly in their
universal belief in spirits called <i>iwi</i> or <i>s&iacute;ya</i>, who, like the <i>nats</i>
of Indo-China, cause sickness and death unless scared away
or appeased by offerings. Like the Burmese, also, they place
a piece of money in the mouth or against the cheek of a
corpse before burial, to help in the other world.</p>

<p>One of the few industries is the manufacture of a peculiar
kind of rough painted pottery, which is absolutely confined to
the islet of Chowra, 5 miles north of Teressa. The reason of
this restriction is explained by a popular legend, according to
which in remote ages the Great Unknown decreed that, on
pain of sudden death, an earthquake, or some such calamity,
the making of earthenware was to be carried on only in
Chowra, and all the work of preparing the clay, moulding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
and firing the pots, was to devolve on the women. Once, a
long time ago, one of these women, when on a visit in another
island, began, heedless of the divine injunction, to make a
vessel, and fell dead on the spot. Thus was confirmed the
tradition, and no attempt has since been made to infringe the
"Chowra monopoly<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>."</p>

<p>All things considered, it may be inferred that the archipelago
was originally occupied by primitive peoples of Malayan
stock now represented by the Shom Pen of Great Nicobar,
and was afterwards re-settled on the coastlands by Indo-Chinese
and Malayan intruders, who intermingled, and either
extirpated or absorbed, or else drove to the interior the first
occupants. Nicobar thus resembles Formosa in its intermediate
position between the continental and Oceanic Mongol
populations. Another point of analogy is the absence of
Negritoes from both of these insular areas, where anthropologists
had confidently anticipated the presence of a dark
element like that of the Andamanese and Philippine Aeta.</p>

together the Malays, who belong to the Mongol, and the Polynesians, who belong
to the Caucasic division. But as both undoubtedly speak languages of the same
linguistic stock the expression is permitted in philology, although, as P. W. Schmidt
points out, "Malay" and "Polynesian" are not of equal rank: and the combination
is as unbalanced as "Indo-Bavarian" for "Indo-Germanic"; it is best therefore to
adopt Schmidt's term <i>Austronesian</i> for this family of languages (<i>Die Mon-Khmer

I addressed in a few broken Malay sentences, resented in his sleepy way the
imputation that he was an Orang-Mal&aacute;yu, explaining that he was <i>Orang Java</i>,
a Javanese, and (when further questioned) <i>Orang Solo</i>, a native of the Solo
district, East Java. It was interesting to notice the very marked Mongolic features
of these natives, vividly recalling the remark of A. R. Wallace, on the difficulty of
distinguishing between a Javanese and a Chinaman when both are dressed alike.
The resemblance may to a small extent be due to "mixture with Chinese blood"
(B. Hagen, <i>Jour. Anthrop. Soc.</i> Vienna, 1889); but occurs over such a wide area
that it must mainly be attributed to the common origin of the Chinese and Javanese
peoples.</p></div>

Sumatra, John Mathew reads the word <i>Daibattah</i> in the legend on the head-dress
of a gigantic figure seen by Sir George Grey on the roof of a cave on the Glenelg
river, North-west Australia ("The Cave Paintings of Australia," etc., in <i>Journ. Anthr.

statement that "the Battas of Sumatra believe in the existence of one supreme
being, whom they name <i>Debati Hasi Asi</i>. Since completing the work of creation
they suppose him to have remained perfectly quiescent, having wholly committed
the government to his three sons, who do not govern in person, but by vakeels or
proxies." Here is possibly another confirmation of the view that early Malayan
migrations or expeditions, some even to Australia, took place in pre-Muhammadan
times, long before the rise and diffusion of the Orang-Mal&aacute;yu in the Archipelago.</p></div>

Mrs Z. Colvile, who found that in the east coast districts the natives (Betsimisarakas
chiefly) were black "with short, curly hair and negro type of feature, and showed
every sign of being of African origin. The Hovas, on the contrary, had complexions
little darker than those of the peasantry of Southern Europe, straight black hair,
rather sharp features, slim figures, and were unmistakably of the Asiatic type"
(<i>Round the Black Man's Garden</i>, 1893, p. 143). But even amongst the Hovas a
strain of black blood is betrayed in the generally rather thick lips, and among the
lower classes in the wavy hair and dark skin.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Domain of the
Northern
Mongols.</div>

<p>By "Northern Mongols" are here to be understood all
those branches of the Mongol Division of mankind which
are usually comprised under the collective geographical expression
<i>Ural-Altaic</i>, to which corresponds the ethnical
designation <i>Mongolo-Tatar</i>, or more properly
<i>Mongolo-Turki</i><a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>. Their domain is roughly separated
from that of the Southern Mongols (Chap.
VI.) by the Great Wall and the Kuen-lun range, beyond which
it spreads out westwards over most of Western Asia, and a
considerable part of North Europe, with many scattered groups
in Central and South Russia, the Balkan Peninsula, and the
Middle Danube basin. In the extreme north their territory
stretches from the shores of the Pacific with Japan and
parts of Sakhalin continually westwards across Korea, Siberia,
Central and North Russia to Finland and Lapland. But its
southern limits can be indicated only approximately by a line
drawn from the Kuen-lun range westwards along the northern
escarpments of the Iranian plateau, and round the southern
shores of the Caspian to the Mediterranean. This line, however,
must be drawn in such a way as to include Afghan
Turkestan, much of the North Persian and Caucasian steppes,
and nearly the whole of Asia Minor, while excluding Armenia,
Kurdestan, and Syria.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early Contact
with Caucasic
Peoples.</div>

<p>Nor is it to be supposed that even within these limits the
North Mongol territory is everywhere continuous. In East
Europe especially, where they are for the most
part comparatively recent intruders, the Mongols
are found only in isolated and vanishing groups
in the Lower and Middle Volga basin, the Crimea, and the
North Caucasian steppe, and in more compact bodies in
Rumelia, Bulgaria, and Hungary. Throughout all these
districts, however, the process of absorption or assimilation to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
the normal European physical type is so far completed that
many of the Nogai and other Russian "Tartars," as they are
called, the Volga and Baltic Finns, the Magyars, and Osmanli
Turks, would scarcely be recognised as members of the North
Mongol family but for their common Finno-Turki speech,
and the historic evidence by which their original connection
with this division is established beyond all question.</p>

<p>In Central Asia also (North Irania, the Aralo-Caspian and
Tarim basins) the Mongols have been in close contact with
Caucasic peoples probably since the New Stone Age, and
here intermediate types have been developed, by which an
almost unbroken transition has been brought about between
the yellow and the white races.</p>

(a member of the first Pumpelly Expedition) in 1905-7 all
bear testimony to the variation in climate which the districts
of Central Asia have undergone since glacial times. There
has been a general trend towards arid conditions, alternating
with periods of greater humidity, when tracts, now deserted,
were capable of maintaining a dense population. Abundant
evidence of man's occupation has been found in delta oases
formed by snow-fed mountain streams, or on the banks of
vanished rivers, where now-a-days all is desolation, though,
as T. Peisker<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> points out, climate was not the sole or even the
main factor in many areas. In some places, as at Merv, the
earliest occupation was only a few centuries before the Christian
era, but at Anau near Askhabad some 300 miles east of the
Caspian, explored by the Pumpelly Expedition, the earliest
strata contained remains of Stone Age culture. The North<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
Kurgan or tumulus, rising some 40 or 50 feet above the plain,
showed a definite stratification of structures in sun-dried bricks,
raised by successive generations of occupants. H. Schmidt,
who was in charge of the excavations, was able to collect a
valuable series of potsherds, showing a gradual evolution in
form, technique and ornamentation, from the earliest to the
latest periods. One point of great significance for establishing
cultural if not physical relationships in this obscure region is
the resemblance between the geometrical designs on pots of
the early period and similar pottery found by MM. Gautier
and Lampre<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> at Mussian, and by M. J. de Morgan<a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> at Susa,
while clay figurines from the South Kurgan (copper culture)
are clearly of Babylonian type, the influence of which is seen
much later in terra-cotta figurines discovered by Stein<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> at
Yotkan.</p>

<p>With the progress of archaeological research, it becomes
daily more evident that the whole of the North Mongol
domain, from Finland to Japan, has passed through the Stone
and Metal Ages, like most other habitable parts of the globe.
During his wanderings in Siberia and Mongolia in the early
nineties, Hans Leder<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> came upon countless prehistoric stations,
kurgans (barrows), stone circles, and many megalithic monuments
of various types. In West Siberia the barrows, which
consist solely of earth without any stone-work, are by the
present inhabitants called <i>Chudskiye Kurgani</i>, "Chudish
Graves," and, as in North Russia, this term "Chude" is
ascribed to a now vanished unknown race which formerly
inhabited the land. To them, as to the "Toltecs" in Central
America, all ancient monuments are credited, and while some
regard them as prehistoric Finns, others identify them with the
historic Scythians, the Scythians of Herodotus.</p>

<p>There are reasons, however, for thinking that the Chudes
may represent an earlier race, the men of the Stone Age, who,
migrating from north Europe eastwards, had reached the Tom
valley (which drains to the Obi) before the extinction of the

monuments now being daily brought to light in East Siberia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
Mongolia, Korea, and Japan. This view receives support from
the characters of two skulls found in 1895 by A. P. Mostitz in
one of the five prehistoric stations on the left bank of the Sava
affluent of the Selenga river, near Ust-Kiakta in Trans-Baikalia.
They differ markedly from the normal Buryat
(Siberian Mongol) type, recalling rather the long-shaped skulls
of the South Russian kurgans, with cephalic indices 73.2 and
73.5, as measured by M. J. D. Talko-Hryncewicz<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>. Thus, in
the very heart of the Mongol domain, the characteristically
round-headed race would appear to have been preceded, as in
Europe, by a long-headed type.</p>

<p>In East Siberia, and especially in the Lake Baikal region,
Leder found extensive tracts strewn with kurgans, many of
which have already been explored, and their contents deposited
in the Irkutsk museum. Amongst these are great numbers
of stone implements, and objects made of bone and mammoth
tusks, besides carefully worked copper ware, betraying
technical skill and some artistic taste in the designs. In
Trans-Baikalia, still farther east, with the kurgans are associated
the so-called <i>Kameni Babi</i>, "Stone Women," monoliths
rough-hewn in the form of human figures. Many of these
monoliths bear inscriptions, which, however, appear to be of
recent date (mostly Buddhist prayers and formularies), and
are not to be confounded with the much older rock inscriptions
deciphered by W. Thomsen through the Turki language.</p>

<p>Continuing his investigations in Mongolia proper, Leder
here also discovered earthen kurgans, which, however,
differed from those of Siberia by being for the most part
surmounted either with circular or rectangular stone structures,
or else with monoliths. They are called <i>K&uuml;r&uuml;kts&uacute;r</i> by the
present inhabitants, who hold them in great awe, and never
venture to touch them. Unfortunately strangers also are
unable to examine their contents, all disturbance of the ground
with spade or shovel being forbidden under pain of death by
the Chinese officials, for fear of awakening the evil spirits,
now slumbering peacefully below the surface. The Siberian
burial mounds have yielded no bronze, a fact which indicates
considerable antiquity, although no date can be set for its
introduction into these regions. Better evidence of antiquity
is found in the climatic changes resulting in recent desiccation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
which must have taken place here as elsewhere, for the burials
bear witness to the existence of a denser population than could
be supported at the present time<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early Man in
Korea and
Japan.</div>

<p>Such an antiquity is indeed required to explain the spread
of neolithic remains to the Pacific seaboard, and especially
to Korea and Japan. In Korea W. Gowland
examined a dolmen 30 miles from Seul, which
he describes and figures<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>, and which is remarkable
especially for the disproportionate size of the capstone,
a huge undressed megalith 14&frac12; by over 13 feet. He refers to
four or five others, all in the northern part of the peninsula,
and regards them as "intermediate in form between a cist and
a dolmen." But he thinks it probable that they were never
covered by mounds, but always stood as monuments above
ground, in this respect differing from the Japanese, the majority
of which are all buried in tumuli. In some of their features
these present a curious resemblance to the Brittany structures,
but no stone implements appear to have been found in any
of the burial mounds, and the Japanese chambered tombs,
according to Hamada, Professor of Archaeology in Kyoto
University, are usually attributed to the Iron Age (fifth to
seventh centuries <small>A.D.</small><a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>).</p>

<p>In many districts Japan contains memorials of a remote
past&mdash;shell mounds, cave-dwellings, and in Yezo certain pits,
which are not occupied by the present Ainu population, but
are by them attributed to the <i>Koro-pok-guru</i>, "People of the
Hollows," who occupied the land before their arrival, and
lived in huts built over these pits. Similar remains on an islet
near Nemuro on the north-east coast of Yezo are said by the
Japanese to have belonged to the <i>Kobito</i>, a dwarfish race exterminated
by the Ainu, hence apparently identical with the
Koro-pok-guru. They are associated by John Milne with
some primitive peoples of the Kurile Islands, Sakhalin, and
Kamchatka, who, like the Eskimo of the American coast, had
extended formerly much farther south than at present.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>In a kitchen-midden, 330 by 200 feet, near Shiidzuka in
the province of Ibaraki, the Japanese antiquaries S. Yagi and
M. Shinomura<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> have found numerous objects belonging to the
Stone Age of Japan. Amongst them were flint implements,
worked bones, ashes, pottery, and a whole series of clay figures
of human beings. The finders suggest that these remains may
have belonged to a homogeneous race of the Stone Period,
who, however, were not the ancestors of the Ainu&mdash;hitherto
generally regarded as the first inhabitants of Japan. In the
national records vague reference is made to other aborigines,
such as the "Long Legs," and the "Eight Wild Tribes,"
described as the enemies of the first Japanese settlers in Kiu-shiu,
and reduced by Jimmu Tenno, the semi-mythical founder
of the present dynasty; the <i>Ebisu</i>, who are probably to be
identified with the Ainu; and the <i>Seki-Manzi</i>, "Stone-Men,"
also located in the southern island of Kiu-shiu. The last-mentioned,
of whom, however, little further is known, seem to
have some claim to be associated with the above described
remains of early man in Japan<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early Man in

<p>In the extreme west the present Mongol peoples, being
quite recent intruders, can in no way be connected with the
abundant prehistoric relics daily brought to light
in that region (South Russia, the Balkan Peninsula,
Hungary). The same remark applies even
to Finland itself, which was at one time supposed to be the
cradle of the Finnish people, but is now shown to have been
first occupied by Germanic tribes. From an exhaustive study
of the bronze-yielding tumuli A. Hackman<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> concludes that the
population of the Bronze Period was Teutonic, and in this he
agrees both with Montelius and with W. Thomsen. The
latter holds on linguistic grounds that at the beginning of the
new era the Finns still dwelt east of the Gulf of Finland,
whence they moved west in later times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early Man in
Babylonia.</div>

<p>It is unfortunate that, owing probably to the character of
the country, remains of the Stone Age in Babylonia are wanting
so that no comparison can yet be made with the neolithic
cultures of Egypt and the Aegean. The constant floods to
which Babylonia was ever subject swept away all traces of
early occupations until the advent of the Sumerians, who built
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>their cities on artificial mounds. The question of Akkado-Sumerian<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>
origins is by no means clear, for many important
cities are unexplored and even unidentified, but the general
trend of recent opinion may be noted. The
linguistic problem is peculiarly complicated by
the fact that almost all the Sumerian texts show
evidence of Semitic influence, and consist to a great extent of
religious hymns and incantations which often appear to be
merely translations of Semitic ideas turned by Semitic priests
into the formal religious Sumerian language. J. Hal&eacute;vy,
indeed, followed by others, regarded Sumerian as no true
language, but merely a priestly system of cryptography<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>, based
on Semitic. As regards linguistic affinities, K. A. Hermann<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>
endeavoured to establish a connection between the early texts
and Ural-Altaic, more especially with Ugro-Finnish. A more
recent suggestion that the language is of Indo-European origin
and structure rests on equally slight resemblances. The comparison
with Chinese has already been noticed. J. D. Prince<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>
utters a word of caution against comparing ancient texts with
idioms of more recent peoples of Western Asia, in spite of
many tempting resemblances, and claims that until further
light has been shed on the problem Sumerian should be
regarded as standing quite alone, "a prehistoric philological
remnant."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sumerians.</div>

<p>E. Meyer<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> claims for the Sumerians not only linguistic
but also physical isolation. The Sumerian type as represented
on the monuments shows a narrow pointed
nose, with straight bridge and small nostrils,
cheeks and lips not fleshy, like the Semites, with prominent
cheek-bones, small mouth, narrow lips finely curved, the lower
jaw very short, with angular sharply projecting chin, oblique
Mongolian eyes, low forehead, usually sloping away directly
from the root of the nose. In fact the nose has almost the
appearance of a bird's beak, projecting far in advance of mouth
and chin, while the forehead almost disappears. The hair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
and beard are closely shaven. The Sumerians were undoubtedly
a warlike people, fighting not like the Semites in
loosely extended battle array, but in close phalanx, their large
shields protecting their bodies from neck to feet, forming
a rampart beyond which projected the inclined spears of the
foremost rank. Battle axe and javelin were also used. Helmets
protected head and neck. Besides lance or spear the royal
leaders carried a curved throwing weapon, formed of three
strands bound together at intervals with thongs of leather or
bands of metal; this seems to have developed later into a sign
of authority and hence into a sceptre. The bow, the typical
weapon of the Semites and the mountainous people to the east,
was unrepresented. The gods carried clubs with stone heads.
It is important to notice that, in direct contrast to the
Sumerians themselves, their gods had abundant hair on their
heads, carefully curled and dressed, and a long curly beard on
the chin, though cheeks and lips were closely shaven; these
fashions recall those of the Semites. Thus, although the
general view is to regard the Sumerians as the autochthones
and the Semites as the later intruders in Babylonia, the
Semitic character of the Sumerian gods points to an opposite
conclusion. But the time has not yet come for any definite
conclusion to be reached. All that can be said is that according
to our present knowledge the assumption that the earliest
population was Sumerian and that the Semites were the
conquering intruders is only slightly more probable than the
reverse<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>.</p>

<p>Recent archaeological discoveries make Sumerian origins
a little clearer. Explorations in Central Asia (as mentioned
above p. 257) show that districts once well watered, and
capable of supporting a large population, have been subject to
periods of excessive drought, and this no doubt is the prime
cause of the racial unrest which has ever been characteristic
of the dwellers in these regions. A cycle of drought may well
have prompted the Sumerian migration of the fourth millennium
<small>B.C.</small>, as it is shown to have prompted the later invasions
of the last two thousand years<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>. Although there is no evidence
to connect the original home of the Sumerians with any of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
oases yet excavated in Central Asia, yet signs of cultural
contact are not wanting, and it may safely be inferred that
their civilisation was evolved in some region to the east of
the Euphrates valley before their entrance into Babylonia<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Akkadians.</div>

<p>Since Semitic influence was first felt in the north of
Babylonia, at Akkad, it is assumed that the immigration was
from the north-west from Arabia by way of the
Syrian coastlands, and in this case also the
impulse may have been the occurrence of an arid period in the
centre of the Arabian continent. The Semites are found not
as barbarian invaders, but as a highly cultivated people. They
absorbed several cultural elements of the Sumerians, notably
their script, and were profoundly influenced by Sumerian
religion. The Akkadians are represented with elaborately
curled hair and beard, and hence, in contradistinction to the
shaven Sumerians, are referred to as "the black-headed ones."
Their chief weapon was the bow, but they had also lances and
battle axes. As among the Sumerians the sign of kingship
was a boomerang-like sceptre<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>. Except for Babylon and
Sippar, which throw little light on the early periods, no systematic
excavation has been undertaken in northern Babylonia,
and the site of Akkad is still unidentified.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Babylonian
Chronology.</div>

<p>The chronology of this early age of Babylonia is much
disputed. The very high dates of 5000 or 6000 <small>B.C.</small> formerly
assigned by many writers to the earliest remains
of the Sumerians and the Babylonian Semites,
depended to a great extent on the statement of
Nabonidus (556 <small>B.C.</small>) that 3200 years separated his own age
from that of Naram-Sin, the son of Sargon of Agade; for to
Sargon, on this statement alone, a date of 3800 has usually
been assigned<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>. This date presents many difficulties, leaving
many centuries unrepresented by any royal names or records.
Even the suggested emendation of the text reducing the estimate
by a thousand years is not generally acceptable. Most
authorities hesitate to date any Babylonian records before
3000 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> and agree that the time has not arrived for fixing
any definite dates for the early period.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>Despite the legendary matter associated with his memory,
Shar-Gani-sharri, commonly called Sargon of Akkad, about
2500 <small>B.C.</small> (Meyer), 2650 <small>B.C.</small> (King), was beyond question a
historical person though it seems that there has been some
confusion with Sharru-gi, or Sharrukin, also called Sargon,
earliest king of Kish<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>. Tradition records how his mother,
a royal princess, concealed his birth by placing him in a rush
basket closed with bitumen and sending him adrift on the
stream, from which he was rescued by Akki the water-carrier,
who brought him up as his own child. The incident, about
which there is nothing miraculous, presents a curious parallel to,
if it be not the source of, similar tales related of Moses, Cyrus,
and other ancient leaders of men. Sargon also tells us that he
ruled from his capital, Agade, for 45 years over Upper and
Lower Mesopotamia, governed the black-headed ones, as the
Akkads are constantly called, rode in bronze chariots over
rugged lands, and made expeditions thrice to the sea-coast.
The expeditions are confirmed by inscriptions from Syria,
though the cylinder of his son, Naram-Sin, found by Cesnola
in Cyprus, is now regarded as of later date<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>. As they also
penetrated to Sinai their influence appears to have extended
over the whole of Syria and North Arabia. They erected
great structures at Nippur, which was at that time so ancient
that Naram-Sin's huge brick platform stood on a mass 30 feet
thick of the accumulated debris of earlier buildings. Among
the most interesting of recent discoveries at Nippur are pre-Semitic
tablets containing accounts similar to those recorded
in the book of Genesis, from which in some cases the latter have
clearly been derived. The "Deluge Fragment" published in
1910 relates the warning given by the god Ea to Utnapishtim,
the Babylonian Noah, and the directions for building a ship
by means of which he and his family may escape, together
with the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>. A still
later discovery agrees more closely with the Bible version,
giving the name of the one pious man as Tagtog, Semitic
N&ucirc;hu, and assigning nine months as the period of the duration
of the flood. The same tablet also contains an account of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
Fall of Man; but it is Noah, not Adam, who is tempted and
falls, and the forbidden fruit is cassia<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Elamite
Origins.</div>

<p>Sennacherib's grandson, Ashurbanipal, who belongs to the
late Assyrian empire when the centre of power had been
shifted from Babylonia to Nineveh, has left recorded
on his brick tablets how he overran Elam
and destroyed its capital, Susa (645 <small>B.C.</small>). He
states that from this place he brought back the effigy of the
goddess, Nana, which had been carried away from her temple
at Erech by an Elamite king by whom Akkad had been conquered
1635 years before, <i>i.e.</i> 2280 <small>B.C.</small> Over Akkad Elam
ruled 300 years, and it was a king of this dynasty, Khudur-Lagamar,
who has been identified by T. G. Pinches with the
"Chedorlaomer, king of Elam" routed by Abraham (Gen.
xiv. 14-17)<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a>. Thus is explained the presence of Elamites at
this time so far west as Syria, their own seat being amid the
Kurdish mountains in the Upper Tigris basin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Historical
Records.</div>

<p>The Elamites do not appear to have been of the same
stock as the Sumerians. They are described as peaceful, industrious,
and skilful husbandmen, with a surprising knowledge
of irrigating processes. The non-Semitic language shows
possible connections with Mitanni<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>. Yet the type would
appear to be on the whole rather Semitic, judging at least
from the large arched nose and thick beard of the
Susian god, Ramman, brought by Ashurbanipal
out of Elam, and figured in Layard's <i>Monuments
of Nineveh</i>, 1st Series, Plate 65. This, however, may be explained
by the fact that the Elamites were subdued at an early
date by intruding Semites, although they afterwards shook off
the yoke and became strong enough to conquer Mesopotamia
and extend their expeditions to Syria and the Jordan.
The capital of Elam was the renowned city of Susa
(Shushan, whence Susiana, the modern Khuzistan). Recent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
excavations show that the settlement dates from neolithic
times<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>.</p>

<p>Even after the capture of Susa by Ashurbanipal, Elam
again rose to great power under Cyrus the Great, who, however,
was no Persian adventurer, as stated by Herodotus, but
the legitimate Elamite ruler, as inscribed on his cylinder and
tablet now in the British Museum:&mdash;"Cyrus, the great king,
the king of Babylon, the king of Sumir and Akkad, the king
of the four zones, the son of Kambyses, the great king, the
king of Elam, the grandson of Cyrus the great king," who by
the favour of Merodach has overcome the black-headed people
(<i>i.e.</i> the Akkads) and at last entered Babylon in peace. On
an earlier cylinder Nabonidus, last king of Babylon, tells us
how this same Cyrus subdued the Medes&mdash;here called <i>Mandas</i>,
"Barbarians"&mdash;and captured their king Astyages and his
capital Ekbatana. But although Cyrus, hitherto supposed to
be a Persian and a Zoroastrian monotheist, here appears as an
Elamite and a polytheist, "it is pretty certain that although
descended from Elamite kings, these were [at that time]
kings of Persian race, who, after the destruction of the old
[Elamite] monarchy by Ashurbanipal, had established a new
dynasty at the city of Susa. Cyrus always traces his descent
from Ach&aelig;menes, the chief of the leading Persian clan of Pasargad&aelig;<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>."
Hence although wrong in speaking of Cyrus as an
adventurer, Herodotus rightly calls him a Persian, and at this
late date Elam itself may well have been already Aryanised in
speech<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>, while still retaining its old Sumerian religion. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
Babylonian pantheon survived, in fact, till the time of Darius
Hystaspes, who introduced Zoroastrianism with its supreme
gods, Ahura-Mazda, creator of all good, and Ahriman, author
of all evil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Babylonian
Religion.</div>

<p>It is now possible to gain some idea of the gradual growth
of the city states of Babylonia. Beginning with a mere collection
of rude reed huts, these were succeeded by
structures of sun-dried bricks, built in a group for
mutual protection, probably around a centre of a
local god, and surrounded by a wall. The land around the
settlement was irrigated by canals, and here the corn and
vegetables were grown and the flocks and herds were tended
for the maintenance of the population. The central figure was
always the god, who occasionally gave his name to the site,
and who was the owner of all the land, the inhabitants being
merely his tenants who owed him rent for their estates. It
was the god who waged wars with the neighbours, and with
whom treaties were made. The treaty between Lagash and
Umma fixing the limitations of their boundaries, a constant
matter of dispute, was made by Ningirsu, god of Lagash, and
the city god of Umma, under the arbitration of Enlil, the chief
of the gods, whose central shrine was at Nippur.</p>

<p>With the growth of the cities disputes of territory were
sure to arise, and either by conquest or amalgamation, cities
became absorbed into states. The problem then was the
adjustment of the various city gods, each reigning supreme
in his own city, but taking a higher or lower place in the
Babylonian pantheon. When one city gained a supremacy
over all its neighbours, its governor might assume the title of
king. But the king was merely the <i>patesi</i>, the steward of the
city god. Even when the supremacy was sufficiently permanent
for the establishment of a dynasty, this was a dynasty
of the city rather than of a family, for the successive kings
were not necessarily of the same family<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>.</p>

<p>Among the city gods who developed into powerful deities
were Anu of Uruk (Erech), Enlil of Nippur and Ea of Eridu
(originally a sea-port). These became the supreme triad, Anu
ruling over the heavens, enthroned on the northern pole, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
king and father of the gods; Enlil, the Semitic Bel, god of
earth, lord of the lands, formerly chief of all the gods; and
Ea, god of the water-depths, whose son was ultimately to
eclipse his father as Marduk of Babylon. A second triad is
composed of the local deities who developed into Sin, the
moon-god of Ur, Shamash the sun-god of Larsa, and the
famous Ishtar, the great mother, goddess of love and queen of
heaven. The realm of the dead was a dark place under the
earth, where the dead lived as shadows, eating the dust of
the earth. Their lot depended partly on their earlier lives,
and partly on the devotion of their surviving relatives. Although
their dead kings were deified there seems to be no
evidence for a belief in a general resurrection or in the transmigration
of souls. The hymns and prayers to the gods
however show a very high religious level in spite of the
important part played by soothsaying and exorcism, relics
of earlier culture. The permanence of these may be partly
ascribed to the essentially theocratic character of Babylonian
government. The king was merely the agent of the god,
whose desires were interpreted by the priestly soothsayers and
exorcists, and no action could be undertaken in worldly or in
religious concerns without their superintendence. The kings
occasionally attempted to free themselves from the power of
the priests, but the attempt was always vain. The power of
the priests had often a sound economic basis, for the temples
of the great cities were centres of vast wealth and of far-reaching
trade, as is proved by the discovery of the commercial
contracts stored in the temple archives<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Social System.</div>

<p>How the family expands through the clan and tribe into
the nation, is clearly seen in the Babylonian social system,
in which the inhabitants of each city were still
"divided into clans, all of whose members claimed
to be descended from a common ancestor who had flourished
at a more or less remote period. The members of each clan
were by no means all in the same social position, some having
gone down in the world, others having raised themselves; and
amongst them we find many different callings&mdash;from agricultural
labourers to scribes, and from merchants to artisans. No
natural tie existed among the majority of these members except
the remembrance of their common origin, perhaps also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
a common religion, and eventual rights of succession or claims
upon what belonged to each one individually<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>." The god or
goddess, it is suggested, who watched over each man, and of
whom each was the son, was originally the god or goddess of
the clan (its totem). So also in Egypt, the members of the
community were all supposed to come of the same stock (<i>p&aacute;it</i>),
and to belong to the same family (<i>p&aacute;itu</i>), whose chiefs (<i>rop&aacute;itu</i>)
were the guardians of the family, several groups of such
families being under a <i>rop&aacute;it&uacute;-h&aacute;</i>, or head chief<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>.</p>

<p>Amongst the local institutions, it is startling to find a fully
developed ground-landlord system, though not quite so bad
as that still patiently endured in England, already flourishing
ages ago in Babylonia. "The cost of repairs fell usually on
the lessee, who was also allowed to build on the land he had
leased, in which case it was declared free of all charges for
a period of about ten years; but the house and, as a rule, all
he had built, then reverted to the landlord<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">General Culture.</div>

<p>In many other respects great progress had been made, and
it is the belief of von Ihring<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>, Hommel<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> and others that from
Babylonia was first diffused a knowledge of
letters, astronomy, agriculture, navigation, architecture,
and other arts, to the Nile valley, and mainly through
Egypt to the Western World, and through Irania to China
and India. In this generalisation there is probably a large
measure of truth, although it will be seen farther on that the
Asiatic origin of Egyptian culture is still far from being proved<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>.</p>

<p>One element the two peoples certainly had in common&mdash;a
highly developed agricultural system, which formed the
foundation of their greatness, and was maintained in a rainless
climate by a stupendous system of irrigation works. Such
works were carried out on a prodigious scale by the ancient
Babylonians six or eight thousand years ago. The plains of
the Lower Euphrates and Tigris, since rendered desolate
under Turkish misrule, are intersected by the remains of an
intricate network of canalisation covering all the space between
the two rivers, and are strewn with the ruins of many great
cities, whose inhabitants, numbering scores of thousands, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
supported by the produce of a highly cultivated region, which
is now an arid waste varied only by crumbling mounds, stagnant
waters, and the camping-grounds of a few Arab tent-dwellers.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="sidenote">The Mongols
Proper.</div>

<p>Those who attach weight to distinctive racial qualities
have always found a difficulty in attributing this wonderful
civilisation to the same Mongolic people, who in
their own homes have scarcely anywhere advanced
beyond the hunting, fishing, or pastoral
states. But it has always to be remembered that man, like all
other zoological forms, necessarily reflects the character of his
environment. The Mongols might in time become agriculturalists
in the alluvial Mesopotamian lands, though the kindred
people who give their name to the whole ethnical division and
present its physical characters in an exaggerated form, ever
remain tented nomads on the dry Central Asiatic steppe, which
yields little but herbage, and is suitable for tillage only in a few
more favoured districts. Here the typical Mongols, cut off
from the arable lands of South Siberia by the Tian-shan and
Altai ranges, and to some extent denied access to the rich
fluvial valleys of the Middle Kingdom by the barrier of the
Great Wall, have for ages led a pastoral life in the inhabitable
tracts and oases of the Gobi wilderness and the Ordos region
within the great bend of the Hoang-ho. During the historic
period these natural and artificial ramparts have been several
times surmounted by fierce Mongol hordes, pouring like irresistible
flood-waters over the whole of China and many parts
of Siberia, and extending their predatory or conquering expeditions
across the more open northern plains westwards
nearly to the shores of the Atlantic. But such devastating
torrents, which at intervals convulsed and caused dislocations
amongst half the settled populations of the globe, had little
effect on the tribal groups that remained behind. These continued
and continue to occupy the original camping-grounds,
as changeless and uniform in their physical appearance, mental
characters, and social usages as the Arab bedouins and all
other inhabitants of monotonous undiversified steppe lands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physical Type.</div>

<p>De Ujfalvy's suggestion that the typical Mongols of the
plains, with whom we are now dealing, were originally a long-headed
race, can scarcely be taken seriously. At
present and, in fact, throughout historic times, all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
true Mongol peoples are and have been distinguished by a
high degree of brachycephaly, with cephalic index generally
from 87 upwards, and it may be remembered that the highest
known index of any undeformed skull was that of Huxley's
Mongol (98.21). But, as already noticed, those recovered
from prehistoric, or neolithic kurgans, are found to be dolichocephalous
like those of palaeolithic and early neolithic man in
Europe.</p>

<p>Taken in connection with the numerous prehistoric remains
above recorded from all parts of Central Asia and Siberia,
this fact may perhaps help to bring de Ujfalvy's view into
harmony with the actual conditions. Everything will be explained
by assuming that the proto-Mongolic tribes, spreading
from the Tibetan plateau over the plains now bearing their
name, found that region already occupied by the long-headed
Caucasic peoples of the Stone Ages, whom they either exterminated
or drove north to the Altai uplands, and east to
Manchuria and Korea, where a strong Caucasic strain still
persists. De Ujfalvy's long-heads would thus be, not the
proto-Mongols who were always round-headed, but the long-headed
neolithic pre-Mongol race expelled by them from
Mongolia who may provisionally be termed proto-Nordics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethnical and
Administrative
Divisions.</div>

<p>That this region has been their true home since the first
migrations from the south there can be no doubt. Here land
and people stand in the closest relation one to
the other; here every conspicuous physical
feature recalls some popular memory; every
rugged crest is associated with the name of some national
hero, every lake or stream is still worshipped or held in awe
as a local deity, or else the abode of the ancestral shades.
Here also the Mongols proper form two main divisions, <i>Sharra</i>
in the east and <i>Kalm&uacute;k</i> in the west, while a third group,
the somewhat mixed <i>Buryats</i>, have long been settled in the
Siberian provinces of Irkutsk and Trans-Baikalia. Under the
Chinese semi-military administration all except the Buryats,
who are Russian subjects, are constituted since the seventeenth
century in 41 <i>Aimaks</i> (large tribal groups or principalities
with hereditary khans) and 226 <i>Koshungs</i>, "Banners," that is,
smaller groups whose chiefs are dependent on the khans of
their respective Aimaks, who are themselves directly responsible
to the imperial government. Subjoined is a table
of these administrative divisions, which present a curious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
but effective combination of the tribal and political systems,
analogous to the arrangement in Pondoland and some other
districts in Cape Colony, where the hereditary tribal chief
assumes the functions of a responsible British magistrate.</p>

<p>Since their organisation in Aimaks and Koshungs, the
Mongols have ceased to be a terror to the surrounding peoples.
The incessant struggles between these tented warriors and the
peaceful Chinese populations, which began long before the
dawn of history, were brought to a close with the overthrow of
the Sungarian power in the eighteenth century, when their
political cohesion was broken, and the whole nation reduced
to a state of abject helplessness, from which they cannot now
hope to recover. The arm of Chinese rule could be replaced
only by the firmer grip of the northern autocrat, whose shadow
already lies athwart the Gobi wilderness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buddhism.</div>

<p>Thus the only escape from the crushing monotony of a
purely pastoral life, no longer relieved by intervals of warlike
or predatory expeditions, lies in a survival of the old Shamanist
superstitions, or a further development of the degrading Tibetan
lamaism represented at Urga by the <i>Kutukhtu</i>,
an incarnation of the Buddha only less revered
than the Dalai Lama himself<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>. Besides this High Priest at
Urga, there are over a hundred smaller incarnations&mdash;<i>Gigens</i>,
as they are called&mdash;and these saintly beings possess unlimited
means of plundering their votaries. The smallest favour, the
touch of their garments, a pious ejaculation or blessing, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
regarded as a priceless spiritual gift, and must be paid for with
costly offerings. Even the dead do not escape these exactions.
However disposed of, whether buried or cremated, like the
khans and lamas, or exposed to beasts and birds of prey, as is
the fate of the common folk, "masses," which also command
a high price, have to be said for forty days to relieve their
souls from the torments of the Buddhist purgatory.</p>

<p>It is a singular fact, which, however, may perhaps admit
of explanation, that nearly all the true Mongol peoples have
been Buddhists since the spread of Sakya-Muni's teachings
throughout Central Asia, while their Turki kinsmen are zealous
followers of the Prophet. Thus is seen, for instance, the strange
spectacle of two Mongolic groups, the Kirghiz of the Turki
branch and the Kalmuks of the West Mongol branch, encamped
side by side on the Lower Volga plains, the former
all under the banner of the Crescent, the latter devout worshippers
of all the incarnations of Buddha. But analogous
phenomena occur amongst the European peoples, the Teutons
being mainly Protestants, those of neo-Latin speech mainly
Roman Catholics, and the Easterns Orthodox. From all this,
however, nothing more can be inferred than that the religions
are partly a question of geography, partly determined by racial
temperament and political conditions; while the religious
sentiment, being universal, is above all local or ethnical considerations.</p>

<p>Under the first term of the expression <i>Mongolo-Turki</i>
(p. 256) are comprised, besides the Mongols proper, nearly all
those branches of the division which lie to the east and north-east
of Mongolia, and are in most respects more closely allied
with the Mongol than with the Turki section. Such are the
<i>Tunguses</i>, with the kindred <i>Manchus</i>, <i>Golds</i>, <i>Orochons</i>, <i>Lamuts</i>,
and others of the Amur basin, the Upper Lena head-streams,
the eastern affluents of the Yenisei, and the shores of the Sea
of Okhotsk; the <i>Gilyaks</i> about the Amur estuary and in the
northern parts of Sakhalin; the <i>Kamchadales</i> in South Kamchatka;
in the extreme north-east the <i>Koryaks</i>, <i>Chukchis</i>, and
<i>Yukaghirs</i>; lastly the <i>Koreans</i>, <i>Japanese</i>, and <i>Liu-Kiu (Lu-Chu)
Islanders</i>. To the Mongol section thus belong nearly
all the peoples lying between the Yenisei and the Pacific
(including most of the adjacent archipelagos), and between
the Great Wall and the Arctic Ocean. The only two exceptions
are the <i>Yakuts</i> of the middle and Lower Lena and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
neighbouring Arctic rivers, who are of Turki stock; and the
<i>Ainus</i> of Yezo, South Sakhalin, and some of the Kurile
Islands, who belong to the Caucasic division.</p>

<p>M. A. Czaplicka proposes a useful classification of the
various peoples of Siberia, usually grouped on account of
linguistic affinities as Ural-Altaians, and as "no other part of
the world presents a racial problem of such complexity and in
regard to no other part of the world's inhabitants have ethnologists
of the last hundred years put forward such widely
differing hypotheses of their origin<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>," her tabulation may serve
to clear the way. She divides the whole area<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> into <i>Palaeo-Siberians</i>,
representing the most ancient stock of dwellers in
Siberia, and <i>Neo-Siberians</i>, comprising the various tribes of
Central Asiatic origin who are sufficiently differentiated from
the kindred peoples of their earlier homes as to deserve a
generic name of their own. The Palaeo-Siberians thus include
the <i>Chukchi</i>, <i>Koryak</i>, <i>Kamchadale</i>, <i>Ainu</i>, <i>Gilyak</i>, <i>Eskimo</i>,
<i>Aleut</i>, <i>Yukaghir</i>, <i>Chuvanzy</i> and <i>Ostyak</i> of Yenisei. The
Neo-Siberians include the Finnic Tribes (Ugrian <i>Ostyak</i>, and
<i>Vogul</i>), Samoyedic Tribes, Turkic Tribes (<i>Yakut</i> and Turko-Tatars
of Tobolsk and Tomsk Governments), Mongolic Tribes
(Western Mongols or <i>Kalmuk</i>, Eastern Mongols, and <i>Buryat</i>),
and Tungusic Tribes (<i>Tungus</i>, <i>Chapogir</i>, <i>Gold</i>, <i>Lamut</i>, <i>Manchu</i>,
<i>Manyarg</i>, <i>Oroch</i>, <i>Orochon</i> ("Reindeer Tungus"), <i>Oroke</i>).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Tunguses.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Cradle and
Type.</div>

<p>A striking illustration of the general statement that the
various cultural states are a question not of race, but of environment,
is afforded by the varying social conditions
of the widespread Tungus family, who
are fishers on the Arctic coast, hunters in the East Siberian
woodlands, and for the most part sedentary tillers of the soil
and townspeople in the rich alluvial valleys of the Amur and
its southern affluents. The Russians, from whom we get the
term Tungus<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>, recognise these various pursuits, and speak of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span><i>Horse</i>, <i>Cattle</i>, <i>Reindeer</i>, <i>Dog</i>, <i>Steppe</i>, and <i>Forest</i> Tunguses,
besides the settled farmers and stock-breeders of the Amur.
Their original home appears to have been the
Shan-alin uplands, where they dwelt with the
kindred <i>Niu-chi</i> (Manchus) till the thirteenth
century, when the disturbances brought about by the wars and
conquests of Jenghiz-Khan drove them to their present seat in
East Siberia. The type, although essentially Mongolic in the
somewhat flat features, very prominent cheek-bones, slant eyes,
long lank hair, yellowish brown colour and low stature, seems
to show admixture with a higher race in the shapely frame,
the nimble, active figure, and quick, intelligent expression,
and especially in the variable skull. While generally round
(indices 80&deg; to 84&deg;), the head is sometimes flat on the top, like
that of the true Mongol, sometimes high and short, which, as
Hamy tells us, is specially characteristic of the Turki race<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mental
Characters.</div>

<p>All observers speak in enthusiastic language of the temperament
and moral qualities of the Tunguses, and particularly
of those groups that roam the forests about the
Tunguska tributaries of the Yenisei, which take
their name from these daring hunters and trappers.
"Full of animation and natural impulse, always cheerful even
in the deepest misery, holding themselves and others in like
respect, of gentle manners and poetic speech, obliging without
servility, unaffectedly proud, scorning falsehood, and indifferent
to suffering and death, the Tunguses are unquestionably an
heroic people<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shamanism.</div>

<p>A few have been brought within the pale of the Orthodox
Church, and in the extreme south some are classed as Buddhists.
But the great bulk of the Tungus nation are still
Shamanists. Indeed the very word <i>Shaman</i> is
of Tungus origin, though current also amongst the Buryats
and Yakuts. It is often taken to be the equivalent of priest;
but in point of fact it represents a stage in the development of
natural religion which has scarcely yet reached the sacerdotal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>state. "Although in many cases the shamans act as priests,
and take part in popular and family festivals, prayers, and
sacrifices, their chief importance is based on the performance
of duties which distinguish them sharply from ordinary priests<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>."
Their functions are threefold, those of the medicine-man (the
leech, or healer by supernatural means); of the soothsayer
(the prophet through communion with the invisible world);
and of the priest, especially in his capacity as exorcist, and in
his general power to influence, control, or even coerce the
good and evil spirits on behalf of their votaries.  But as all
spirits are, or were originally, identified with the souls of the
departed, it follows that in its ultimate analysis Shamanism
resolves itself into a form of ancestry-worship.</p>

<p>The system, of which there are many phases reflecting the
different cultural states of its adherents, still prevails amongst
all the Siberian aborigines<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>, and generally amongst all the uncivilised
Ural-Altaic populations, so that here again the religions
strictly reflect the social condition of the peoples. Thus the
somewhat cultured Finns, Turks, Mongols, and Manchus are
all either Christians, Muhammadans, or Buddhists; while the
uncultured but closely related Samoyeds, Ostyaks, Orochons,
Tunguses, Golds, Gilyaks, Koryaks, and Chukchi, are almost
without exception Shamanists.</p>

<p>The shamans do not appear to constitute a special caste or
sacerdotal order, like the hierarchies of the Christian Churches.
Some are hereditary, some elected by popular vote, so to say.
They may be either men, or women (<i>shamanka</i>), married or
single; and if "rank" is spoken of, it simply means greater or
less proficiency in the performance of the duties imposed on
them. Everything thus depends on their personal merits,
which naturally gives rise to much jealousy between the
members of the craft. Thus amongst the "whites" and the
"blacks," that is, those whose dealings are with the good and
the bad spirits respectively, there is in some districts a standing
feud, often resulting in fierce encounters and bloodshed. The
Buryats tell how the two factions throw axes at each other at
great distances, the struggle usually ending in the death of one
of the combatants. The blacks, who serve the evil spirits,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
bringing only disease, death, or ill-luck, and even killing
people by eating up their souls, are of course the least popular,
but also the most dreaded. Many are credited with extraordinary
and even miraculous powers, and there can be no
doubt that they often act up to their reputation by performing
almost incredible conjuring tricks in order to impose on the
credulity of the ignorant, or outbid their rivals for the public
favour. Old Richard Johnson of Chancelour's expedition to
Muscovy records how he saw a Samoyed shaman stab himself
with a sword, then make the sword red hot and thrust it
through his body, so that the point protruded at the back, and
Johnson was able to touch it with his finger. They then bound
the wizard tight with a reindeer-rope, and went through some
performances curiously like those of the Davenport brothers
and other modern conjurers<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>.</p>

<p>To the much-discussed question whether the shamans are
impostors, the best answer has perhaps been given by Castr&egrave;n,
who, speaking of the same Samoyed magicians, remarks that
if they were merely cheats, we should have to suppose that
they did not share the religious beliefs of their fellow-tribesmen,
but were a sort of rationalists far in advance of the times.
Hence it would seem much more probable that they deceived
both themselves and others<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>, while no doubt many bolster up
a waning reputation by playing the mountebank where there
is no danger of detection.</p>

<p>"Shamanism amongst the Siberian peoples," concludes
our Russian authority, "is at the present time in a moribund
condition; it must die out with those beliefs among which
alone such phenomena can arise and flourish. Buddhism on
the one hand, and Muhammadanism on the other, not to
mention Christianity, are rapidly destroying the old ideas of
the tribes among whom the shamans performed. Especially
has the more ancient Black Faith suffered from the Yellow
Faith preached by the lamas. But the shamans, with their
dark mysterious rites, have made a good struggle for life, and
are still frequently found among the native Christians and
Muhammadans. The mullahs and lamas have even been
obliged to become shamans to a great extent, and many Siberian
tribes, who are nominally Christians, believe in shamans, and
have recourse to them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Manchus.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Origins and
Early
Records.</div>

<p>Of all members of the Tungusic family the Manchus alone
can be called a historical people. If they were really descended
from the <i>Khitans</i> of the Sungari valley,
then their authentic records will date from the
tenth century <small>A.D.</small>, when these renowned warriors,
after overthrowing the Pu-ha&iuml; (925), founded the Liao dynasty
and reduced a great part of North China and surrounding lands.
The Khitans, from whom China was known to Marco Polo as
<i>Khitai</i> (Cathay), as it still is to the Russians, were conquered
in 1125 by the <i>Niu-chi</i> (<i>Yu-chi, Nu-chin</i>) of the Shan-alin
uplands, reputed cradle of the Manchu race. These Niu-chi,
direct ancestors of the Manchus, founded (1115)
the State known as that of the "Golden Tartars,"
from <i>Kin</i>, "gold," the title adopted by their
chief Aguta, "because iron (in reference to the <i>Liao</i>, 'Iron'
dynasty) may rust, but gold remains ever pure and bright."
The Kins, however, retained their brightness only a little over
a century, having been eclipsed by Jenghiz-Khan in 1234. But
about the middle of the fourteenth century the Niu-chi again
rose to power under Aishiu-Gioro, who, although of miraculous
birth and surrounded by other legendary matter, appears to
have been a historical person. He may be regarded as the true
founder of the Manchu dynasty, for it was in his time that this
name came into general use. Sing-tsu, one of his descendants,
constructed the palisade, a feeble imitation of the Great Wall,
sections of which still exist. Thai-tsu, a still more famous
member of the family, greatly extended the Manchu Kingdom
(1580-1626), and it was his son Tai-dsung who first assumed
the imperial dignity under the title of Tai-Tsing. After his
death, the Ming dynasty having been overthrown by a rebel
chief, the Manchus were invited by the imperialists to aid in
restoring order, entered Peking in triumph, and, finding that
the last of the Mings had committed suicide, placed Tai-dsung's
nephew on the throne, thus founding the Manchu dynasty
(1644) which lasted down to 1912.</p>

<p>Such has been the contribution of the Manchu people to
history; their contributions to arts, letters, science, in a word,
to the general progress of mankind, have been <i>nil</i>. They
found the Middle Kingdom, after ages of a sluggish growth, in
a state of absolute stagnation, and there they have left it. On

very extinction as a separate nationality<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>. Manchuria, like
Mongolia, is organised in a number of half military, half civil
divisions, the so-called <i>Paki</i>, or "Eight Banners," and the
constant demand made on these reserves, to support the dynasty
and supply trustworthy garrisons for all the strongholds of the
empire, has drawn off the best blood of the people, in fact sapped
its vitality at the fountain-head. Then the rich arable tracts
thus depleted were gradually occupied by agricultural settlers
from the south, with the result that the Manchu race has nearly
disappeared. From the ethnical standpoint the whole region
beyond the Great Wall as far north as the Amur has practically
become an integral part of China, and from the political standpoint
since 1898 an integral part of the Russian empire. Towards
the middle of the nineteenth century the Eight Banners
numbered scarcely more than a quarter of a million, and about
that time the Abb&eacute; Huc declared that "the Manchu nationality
is destroyed beyond recovery. At present we shall look in vain
for a single town or a single village throughout Manchuria
which is not exclusively inhabited by Chinese. The local colour
has been completely effaced, and except a few nomad groups
nobody speaks Manchu<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>."</p>

<p>Similar testimony is afforded by later observers, and Henry
Lansdell, amongst others, remarks that "the Manchu, during
the two centuries they have reigned in China, may be said to
have been working out their own annihilation. Their manners,
language, their very country has become Chinese, and some
maintain that the Manchu proper are now extinct<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Type.</b></div>

<p>But the type, so far from being extinct, may be said to have
received a considerable expansion, especially amongst the populations
of north-east China. The taller stature
and greatly superior physical appearance of the
inhabitants of Tien-tsin and surrounding districts<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> over those
of the southern provinces (Fokien, Kwang-tung), who are the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
chief representatives of the Chinese race abroad, seem best
explained by continual crossings with the neighbouring Manchu
people, at least since the twelfth century, if not earlier.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Dauri.</div>

<p>Closely related to the Manchus (of the same stock says
Sir H. H. Howorth, the distinction being purely political) are
the <i>Dauri</i>, who give their name to the extensive
Daur plateau, and formerly occupied both sides of
the Upper Amur. Daur is, in fact, the name applied by the
Buryats to all the Tungus peoples of the Amur basin. The
Dauri proper, who are now perhaps the best representatives
of the original Manchu type, would seem to have intermingled
at a remote time with the long-headed pre-Mongol populations
of Central Asia. They are "taller and stronger than the Oronchons
[Tungus groups lower down the Amur]; the countenance
is oval and more intellectual, and the cheeks are less broad.
The nose is rather prominent, and the eyebrows straight.
The skin is tawny, and the hair brown<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>." Most of these
characters are such as we should expect to find in a people of
mixed Mongolo-Caucasic descent, the latter element being
derived from the long-headed race who had already reached
the present Mongolia, Manchuria, Korea, and the adjacent
islands during neolithic times. Thus may be explained the
tall stature, somewhat regular features, brown hair, light eyes,
and even florid complexion so often observed amongst the
present inhabitants of Manchuria, Korea, and parts of North
China.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mongolo-Turki
Speech.</div>

<p>But no admixture, except of Chinese literary terms, is seen in
the Manchu language, which, like Mongolic, is a typical member
of the agglutinating Ural-Altaic family. Despite
great differences, lexical, phonetic, and even
structural, all the members of this widespread
order of speech have in common a number of fundamental
features, which justify the assumption that all spring from an
original stock language, which has long been extinct, and the
germs of which were perhaps first developed on the Tibetan
plateau. The essential characters of the system are:&mdash;(1) a
"root" or notional term, generally a closed syllable, nominal
or verbal, with a vowel or diphthong, strong or weak (hard or
soft) according to the meaning of the term, hence incapable of
change; (2) a number of particles or relational terms somewhat
loosely postfixed to the root, but incorporated with it by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
principle of (3) vowel harmony, a kind of vocal concordance,
in virtue of which the vowels of all the postfixes must harmonise
with the unchangeable vowel of the root. If this is strong all
the following vowels of the combination, no matter what its
length, must be strong; if weak they must conform in the same
way. With nominal roots the postfixes are necessarily limited
to the expression of a few simple relations; but with verbal
roots they are in principle unlimited, so that the multifarious
relations of the verb to its subject and object are all incorporated
in the verbal compound itself, which may thus run at times to
inordinate lengths. Hence we have the expression "incorporating,"
commonly applied to this agglutinating system,
which sometimes goes so far as to embody the notions of
causality, possibility, passivity, negation, intensity, condition,
and so on, besides the direct pronominal objects, in one interminable
conglomerate, which is then treated as a simple
verb, and run through all the secondary changes of number,
person, tense, and mood. The result is an endless number of
theoretically possible verbal forms, which, although in practice
naturally limited to the ordinary requirements of speech, are far
too numerous to allow of a complete verbal paradigm being
constructed of any fully developed member of the Ural-Altaic
group, such, for instance, as Yakut, Tungus, Turki, Mordvinian,
Finnish, or Magyar.</p>

<p>In this system the vowels are classed as strong or hard
(<i>a, o, u</i>), weak or soft (the same <i>umlauted</i>: <i>&auml;</i>, <i>&ouml;</i>, <i>&uuml;</i>), and neutral
(generally <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>), these last being so called because they occur
indifferently with the two other classes. Thus, if the determining
root vowel is <i>a</i> (strong), that of the postfixes may be
either <i>a</i> (strong), <i>e</i> or <i>i</i> (neutral); if <i>&auml;</i> (weak), that of the postfixes
may be either <i>&auml;</i> (weak), or <i>e</i> or <i>i</i> as before. The postfixes
themselves no doubt were originally notional terms worn
down in form and meaning, so as to express mere abstract
relation, as in the Magyar <i>vel</i> = with, from <i>veli</i> = companion.
Tacked on to the root <i>fa</i> = tree, this will give the ablative case,
first unharmonised, <i>fa-vel</i>, then harmonised, <i>fa-val</i> = tree-with,
with a tree. In the early Magyar texts of the twelfth century
inharmonic compounds, such as <i>hal&aacute;l-nek</i>, later <i>hal&aacute;k-nak</i> = at
death, are numerous, from which it has been inferred that the
principle of vowel harmony is not an original feature of the
Ural-Altaic languages, but a later development, due in fact to
phonetic decay, and still scarcely known in some members of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
the group, such as Votyak and Highland Cheremissian (Volga
Finn). But M. Lucien Adam holds that these idioms have
lost the principle through foreign (Russian) influence, and that
the few traces still perceptible are survivals from a time when
all the Ural-Altaic tongues were subject to progressive vowel
harmony<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Language
and Racial
Characters.</div>

<p>But however this be, Dean Byrne is disposed to regard the
alternating energetic utterance of the hard, and indolent utterance
of the soft vowel series, as an expression of
the alternating active and lethargic temperament
of the race, such alternations being themselves
due to the climatic conditions of their environment. "Certainly
the life of the great nomadic races involves a twofold experience
of this kind, as they must during their abundant summer provide
for their rigorous winter, when little can be done. Their
character, too, involves a striking combination of intermittent
indolence and energy; and it is very remarkable that this distinction
of roots is peculiar to the languages spoken originally
where this great distinction of seasons exists. The fact that
the distinction [between hard and soft] is imparted to all the
suffixes of a root proves that the radical characteristic which it
expresses is thought with these; and consequently that the
radical idea is retained in the consciousness while these are
added to it<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>."</p>

<p>This is a highly characteristic instance of the methods
followed by Dean Byrne in his ingenious but hopeless attempt
to explain the subtle structure of speech by the still more subtle
temperament of the speaker, taken in connection with the
alternating nature of the climate. The feature in question
cannot be due to such alternation of mood and climate, because
it is persistent throughout all seasons, while the hard and soft
elements occur simultaneously, one might say, promiscuously,
in conversation under all mental states of those conversing.</p>

<p>The true explanation is given by Schleicher, who points out
that progressive vocal assimilation is the necessary result of
agglutination, which by this means binds together the idea and
its relations in their outward expression, just as they are already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
inseparately associated in the mind of the speaker. Hence it
is that such assonance is not confined to the Ural-Altaic
group, analogous processes occurring at certain stages of their
growth in all forms of speech, as in Wolof, Zulu-Xosa, Celtic
(expressed by the formula of Irish grammarians: "broad to
broad, slender to slender"), and even in Latin, as in such vocalic
concordance as: <i>annus, perennis</i>; <i>ars, iners</i>; <i>lego, diligo</i>. In
these examples the root vowel is influenced by that of the prefix,
while in the Mongolo-Turki family the root vowel, coming first,
is unchangeable, but, as explained, influences the vowels of the
postfixes, the phonetic principle being the same in both systems.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mongol and
Manchu Script.</div>

<p>Both Mongol and Manchu are cultivated languages employing
modified forms of the Uiguric (Turki) script, which is based
on the Syriac introduced by the Christian (Nestorian)
missionaries in the seventh century. It
was first adopted by the Mongols about 1280, and
perfected by the scribe Tsorji Osir under Jenezek Khan (1307-1311).
The letters, connected together by continuous strokes,
and slightly modified, as in Syriac, according to their position
at the beginning, middle, or end of the word, are disposed in
vertical columns from left to right, an arrangement due no
doubt to Chinese influence. This is the more probable since
the Manchus, before the introduction of the Mongol system in
the sixteenth century, employed the Chinese characters ever
since the time of the Kin dynasty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Yukaghirs.</div>

<p>None of the other Tungusic or north-east Siberian peoples
possess any writing system except the Yukaghirs of the
Yasachnaya affluent of the Kolymariver, who were
visited in 1892 by the Russian traveller, S. Shargorodsky.
From his report<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>, it appears that this symbolic
writing is carved with a sharp knife out of soft fresh birch-bark,
these simple materials sufficing to describe the tracks followed
on hunting and fishing expeditions, as well as the sentiments
of the young women in their correspondence with their sweethearts.
Specimens are given of these curious documents, some
of which are touching and even pathetic. "Thou goest hence,
and I bide alone, for thy sake still to weep and moan," writes
one disconsolate maid to her parting lover. Another with a
touch of jealousy: "Thou goest forth thy Russian flame to
seek, who stands 'twixt thee and me, thy heart from me apart to
keep. In a new home joy wilt thou find, while I must ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
grieve, as thee I bear in mind, though another yet there be who
loveth me." Or again: "Each youth his mate doth find; my
fate alone it is of him to dream, who to another wedded is, and
I must fain contented be, if only he forget not me." And with
a note of wail: "Thou hast gone hence, and of late it seems
this place for me is desolate; and I too forth must fare, that
so the memories old I may forget, and from the pangs thus flee
of those bright days, which here I once enjoyed with thee."</p>

<p>Details of domestic life may even be given, and one accomplished
maiden is able to make a record in her note-book of the
combs, shawls, needles, thimble, cake of soap, lollipops, skeins
of wool, and other sundries, which she has received from a
Yakut packman, in exchange for some clothes she has made
him. Without illustrations no description of the process would
be intelligible. Indeed it would seem these primitive documents
are not always understood by the young folks themselves.
They gather at times in groups to watch the process
of composition by some expert damsel, the village "notary,"
and much merriment, we are told, is caused by the blunders of
those who fail to read the text aright.</p>

<p>It is not stated whether the system is current amongst the
other Yukaghir tribes, who dwell on the banks of the Indigirka,
Yana, Kerkodona, and neighbouring districts. They thus
skirt the Frozen Ocean from near the Lena delta to and beyond
the Kolyma, and are conterminous landwards with the Yakuts
on the south-west and the Chukchi on the north-east. With
the Chukchi, the Koryaks, the Kamchadales, and the Gilyaks
they form a separate branch of the Mongolic division sometimes
grouped together as "Hyperboreans," but distinguished
from other Ural-Altaic peoples perhaps strictly on linguistic
grounds. Although now reduced to scarcely 1500, the Yukaghirs
were formerly a numerous people, and the popular saying
that their hearths on the banks of the Kolyma at one time
outnumbered the stars in the sky seems a reminiscence of more
prosperous days. But great inroads have been made by epidemics,
tribal wars, the excessive use of coarse Ukraine tobacco
and of bad spirits, indulged in even by the women and children.
"A Yukaghir, it is said, never intoxicates himself alone, but
calls upon his family to share the drink, even children in
arms being supplied with a portion<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>." Their language, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
A. Schiefner regards as radically distinct from all others<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>, is
disappearing even more rapidly than the people themselves,
if it be not already quite extinct. In the eighties it was spoken
only by about a dozen old persons, its place being taken almost
everywhere by the Turki dialect of the Yakuts<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chukchi and
Koryaks.</div>

<p>There appears to be a curious interchange of tribal names
between the Chukchi and their Koryak neighbours, the term
<i>Koryak</i> being the Chukchi <i>Khorana</i>, "Reindeer,"
while the Koryaks are said to call themselves
<i>Chauchau</i>, whence some derive the word
<i>Chukchi</i>. Hooper, however, tells us that the proper form of
Chukchi is <i>Tuski</i>, "Brothers," or "Confederates<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>," and in any
case the point is of little consequence, as Dittmar is probably
right in regarding both groups as closely related, and sprung
originally from one stock<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>. Jointly they occupy the north-east
extremity of the continent between the Kolyma and Bering
Strait, together with the northern parts of Kamchatka; the
Chukchi lying to the north, the Koryaks to the south, mainly
round about the north-eastern inlets of the Sea of Okhotsk.
Reasons have already been advanced for supposing that the
Chukchi were a Tungus people who came originally from the
Amur basin. In their arctic homes they appear to have waged
long wars with the Onkilon (Ang-kali) aborigines, gradually
merging with the survivors and also mingling both with the
Koryaks and Chuklukmiut Eskimo settled on the Asiatic side
of Bering Strait.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chukchi and
Eskimo
Relations.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Type and
Social State.</div>

<p>But their relations to all these peoples are involved in great
obscurity, and while some connect them with the Itelmes of
Kamchatka<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>, by others they have been affiliated
to the Eskimo, owing to the Eskimo dialect said
to be spoken by them. But this "dialect" is only
a trading jargon, a sort of "pidgin Eskimo" current all round
the coast, and consisting of Chukchi, Innuit, Koryak, English,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>and even Hawaii elements, mingled together in varying proportions.
The true Chukchi language, of which Nordenski&ouml;ld
collected 1000 words, is quite distinct from Eskimo, and
probably akin to Koryak<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a>, and the Swedish explorer aptly
remarks that "this race, settled on the primeval route between
the Old and New World, bears an unmistakable stamp of the
Mongols of Asia and the Eskimo and Indians of America."
He was much struck by the great resemblance of the Chukchi
weapons and household utensils to those of the Greenland
Eskimo, while Signe Rink shows that even popular legends
have been diffused amongst the populations on both sides of
Bering Strait<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>. Such common elements, however, prove little
for racial affinity, which seems excluded by the extremely round
shape of the Chukchi skull, as compared with the long-headed
Eskimo. But the type varies considerably both
amongst the so-called "Fishing Chukchi," who
occupy permanent stations along the seaboard,
and the "Reindeer Chukchi," who roam the inland districts,
shifting their camping-grounds with the seasons. There are no
hereditary chiefs, and little deference is paid to the authority
even of the owner of the largest reindeer herds, on whom the
Russians have conferred the title of <i>Jerema</i>, regarding him as
the head of the Chukchi nation, and holding him responsible
for the good conduct of his rude subjects. Although nominal
Christians, they continue to sacrifice animals to the spirits of
the rivers and mountains, and also to practise Shamanist rites.
They believe in an after-life, but only for those who die a
violent death. Hence the resignation and even alacrity with
which the hopelessly infirm and the aged submit, when the time
comes, to be dispatched by their kinsfolk, in accordance with
the tribal custom of <i>kamitok</i>, which still survives in full vigour
amongst the Chukchi, as amongst the Sumatran Battas, and
may be traced in many other parts of the world.</p>

<p>"The doomed one," writes Harry de Windt, "takes a lively
interest in the proceedings, and often assists in the preparation
for his own death. The execution is always preceded by a
feast, where seal and walrus meat are greedily devoured, and
whisky consumed till all are intoxicated. A spontaneous burst
of singing and the muffled roll of walrus-hide drums then herald<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
the fatal moment. At a given signal a ring is formed by the
relations and friends, the entire settlement looking on from the
background. The executioner (usually the victim's son or
brother) then steps forward, and placing his right foot behind
the back of the condemned, slowly strangles him to death with
a walrus-thong. A kamitok took place during the latter part
of our stay<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>."</p>

<p>This custom of "voluntary death" is sometimes due to
sorrow at the death of a near relative, a quarrel at home, or
merely weariness of life, and Bogoras thinks that the custom
of killing old people does not exist as such, but is voluntarily
chosen in preference to the hard life of an invalid<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Koryaks and
Kamchadales.</div>

<p>Most recent observers have come to look upon the Chukchi
and <i>Koryaks</i> as essentially one and the same people, the chief
difference being that the latter are if possible even
more degraded than their northern neighbours<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>.
Like them they are classed as sedentary fisherfolk
or nomad reindeer-owners, the latter, who call themselves
Tumugulu, "Wanderers," roaming chiefly between Ghiyiginsk
Bay and the Anadyr river. Through them the Chukchi merge
gradually in the <i>Itelmes</i>, who are better known as Kamchadales,
from the Kamchatka river, where they are now chiefly concentrated.
Most of the Itelmes are already Russified in speech
and&mdash;outwardly at least&mdash;in religion; but they still secretly
immolate a dog now and then, to propitiate the malevolent
beings who throw obstacles in the way of their hunting and
fishing expeditions. Yet their very existence depends on their
canine associates, who are of a stout, almost wolfish breed,
inured to hunger and hardships, and excellent for sledge
work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Gilyaks.</div>

<p>Somewhat distinct both from all these Hyperboreans and
from their neighbours, the Orochons, Golds, Manegrs and
other Tungus peoples, are the <i>Gilyaks</i>, formerly
widespread, but now confined to the Amur delta
and the northern parts of Sakhalin<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>. Some observers have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
connected them with the Ainu and the Korean aborigines, while
A. Anuchin detects two types&mdash;a Mongoloid with sparse beard,
high cheek-bones, and flat face, and a Caucasic with bushy
beard and more regular features<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>. The latter traits have been
attributed to Russian mixture, but, as conjectured by H. von
Siebold, are more probably due to a fundamental connection
with their Ainu neighbours<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>.</p>

<p>Mentally the Gilyaks take a low position&mdash;H. Lansdell
thought the lowest of any people he had met in Siberia<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>.
Despite the zeal of the Russian missionaries, and the inducements
to join the fold, they remain obdurate Shamanists, and
even fatalists, so that "if one falls into the water the others
will not help him out, on the plea that they would thus be
opposing a higher power, who wills that he should perish....
The soul of the Gilyak is supposed to pass at death into his
favourite dog, which is accordingly fed with choice food; and
when the spirit has been prayed by the shamans out of the dog,
the animal is sacrificed on his master's grave. The soul is then
represented as passing underground, lighted and guided by its
own sun and moon, and continuing to lead there, in its spiritual
abode, the same manner of life and pursuits as in the flesh<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>."</p>

<p>A speciality of the Gilyaks, as well as of their Gold neighbours,
is the fish-skin costume, made from the skins of two
kinds of salmon, and from this all these aborigines are known
to the Chinese as <i>Yupitatse</i>, "Fish-skin-clad-People." "They
strip it off with great dexterity, and by beating with a mallet
remove the scales, and so render it supple. Clothes thus made
are waterproof. I saw a travelling-bag, and even the sail of a
boat, made of this material<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>."</p>

<p>Like the Ainu, the Gilyaks may be called bear-worshippers.
At least this animal is supposed to be one of their chief gods,
although they ensnare him in winter, keep him in confinement,
and when well fattened tear him to pieces, devouring his
mangled remains with much feasting and jubilation.</p>

<p>Since the opening up of Korea, some fresh light has been

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>had included them in the Mongol division, but not without
reserve, adding that "while some might be
taken for Tibetans, others look like an Oceanic
cross; hence the contradictory reports and theories of modern
travellers." Since then the study of some skulls forwarded to
Paris has enabled him to clear up some of the confusion, which
is obviously due to interminglings of different elements dating
from remote (neolithic) times. On the data supplied by these
skulls Hamy classes the Koreans in three groups:&mdash;1. The
natives of the northern provinces (Ping-ngan-tao and Hienking-tao),
strikingly like their Mongol [Tungus] neighbours;
2. Those of the southern provinces (Klingchang-tao
and Thsiusan-lo-tao), descendants of
the ancient Chinhans and Pien-hans, showing
Japanese affinities; 3. Those of the inner provinces (Hoanghae-tao
and Ching-tsing-tao), who present a transitional form
between the northerns and southerns, both in their physical
type and geographical position<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>.</p>

<p>Caucasic features&mdash;light eyes, large nose, hair often brown,
full beard, fair and even white skin, tall stature&mdash;are conspicuous,
especially amongst the upper classes and many of the southern
Koreans<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>. They are thus shown to be a mixed race, the
Mongol element dominating in the north, as might be expected,
and the Caucasic in the south.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Korean Origins
and Records.</div>

<p>These conclusions seem to be confirmed by what is known
of the early movements, migrations, and displacements of the
populations in north-east Asia about the dawn
of history. In these vicissitudes the Koreans, as
they are now called<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>, appear to have first taken
part in the twelfth century <small>B.C.</small>, when the peninsula was already
occupied, as it still is, by Mongols, the <i>Sien-pi</i>, in the north,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
and in the south by several branches of the <i>Hans</i> (<i>San-San</i>),
of whom it is recorded that they spoke a language unintelligible
to the Sien-pi, and resembled the Japanese in appearance,
manners, and customs. From this it may be inferred that the
Hans were the true aborigines, probably direct descendants of
the Caucasic peoples of the New Stone Age, while the Sien-pi
were Mongolic (Tungusic) intruders from the present Manchuria.
For some time these Sien-pi played a leading part in
the political convulsions prior and subsequent to the erection
of the Great Wall by Shih Hwang Ti, founder of the Tsin
dynasty (221-209 <small>B.C.</small>)<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>. Soon after the completion of this
barrier, the <i>Hiung-nu</i>, no longer able to scour the fertile plains
of the Middle Kingdom, turned their arms against the neighbouring
<i>Yu&eacute;-chi</i>, whom they drove westwards to the Sungarian
valleys. Here they were soon displaced by the <i>Usuns</i> (<i>Wusun</i>),
a fair, blue-eyed people of unknown origin, who have
been called "Aryans," and even "Teutons," and whom Ch. de
Ujfalvy identifies with the tall long-headed western blonds (de
Lapouge's <i>Homo Europaeus</i>), mixed with brown round-headed
hordes of white complexion<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>. Accepting this view, we may go
further, and identify the Usuns, as well as the other white
peoples of the early Chinese records, with the already described
Central Asiatic Caucasians of the Stone Ages, whose osseous
remains we now possess, and who come to the surface in the
very first Chinese documents dealing with the turbulent populations
beyond the Great Wall. The white element, with all
the correlated characters, existed beyond all question, for it is
continuously referred to in those documents. How is its
presence in East Central Asia, including Manchuria and Korea,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
to be explained? Only on two assumptions&mdash;<i>proto-historic</i>
migrations from the Far West, barred by the proto-historic
migrations from the Far East, as largely determined by the
erection of the Great Wall; or <i>pre-historic</i> (neolithic) migrations,
also from the Far West, but barred by no serious obstacle,
because antecedent to the arrival of the proto-Mongolic tribes
from the Tibetan plateau. The true solution of the endless
ethnical complications in the extreme East, as in the Oceanic
world, will still be found in the now-demonstrated presence of
a Caucasic element antecedent to the Mongol in those regions.</p>

<p>When the Hiung-nu<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> power was weakened by their westerly
migrations to Sungaria and south-west Siberia (Upper Irtysh
and Lake Balkash depression), and broken into two sections
during their wars with the two Han dynasties (201 <small>B.C.</small>-220
<small>A.D.</small>), the Korean Sien-pi became the dominant nation north
of the Great Wall. After destroying the last vestiges of the
unstable Hiung-nu empire, and driving the Mongolo-Turki
hordes still westwards, the Yuan-yuans, most powerful of all
the Sien-pi tribes, remained masters of East Central Asia for
about 400 years and then disappeared from history<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>. At least
after the sixth century <small>A.D.</small> no further mention is made of the
Sien-pi principalities either in Manchuria or in Korea. Here,
however, they appear still to form a dominant element in the
northern (Mongol) provinces, calling themselves Ghirin
(Khirin), from the Khirin (Sungari) valley of the Amur, where
they once held sway.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>Since those days Korea has been alternately a vassal State
and a province of the Middle Kingdom, with interludes of
Japanese ascendancy, interrupted only by the four centuries of
Kora&iuml; ascendancy (934-1368). This was the most brilliant
epoch in the national records, when Korea was rather the ally
than the vassal of China, and when trade, industry, and the arts,
especially porcelain and bronze work, flourished in the land.
But by centuries of subsequent misrule, a people endowed with
excellent natural qualities have been reduced to the lowest state
of degradation. Before the reforms introduced by the political
events of 1895-96, "the country was eaten up by officialism.
It is not only that abuses without number prevailed, but the
whole system of government was an abuse, a sea of corruption,
without a bottom or a shore, an engine of robbery, crushing
the life out of all industry<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>." But an improvement was speedily
remarked. "The air of the men has undergone a subtle and
real change, and the women, though they nominally keep up
their habits by seclusion, have lost the hang-dog air which distinguished
them at home. The alacrity of movement is a
change also, and has replaced the conceited swing of the <i>yang-ban</i>
[nobles] and the heartless lounge of the peasant." This
improvement was merely temporary. The last years of the century
were marked by the waning of Japanese influence, due
to Russian intrigues, the restoration of absolute monarchy
together with its worst abuses, the abandonment of reforms
and a retrograde movement throughout the kingdom. The
successes of Japan in 1904-5 resulted in the restoration of her
ascendancy, culminating in 1910 in the cession of sovereignty
by the emperor of Korea to the emperor of Japan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion.</div>

<p>The religious sentiment is perhaps less developed than
among any other Asiatic people. Buddhism, introduced about
380 <small>A.D.</small>, never took root, and while the <i>literati</i> are
satisfied with the moral precepts of Confucius, the
rest have not progressed beyond the nature-worship which
was the ancient religion of the land. Every mountain, pass,
ford or even eddy of a river has a spirit to whom offerings
are made. Honour is also paid to ancestors, both royal and
domestic, at their temples or altars, and chapels are built and
dedicated to men who have specially distinguished themselves
in loyalty, virtue or lofty teaching.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Korean
Script.</div>

<p>Philologists now recognise some affinity between the Korean
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>and Japanese languages, both of which appear to be remotely
connected with the Ural-Altaic family. The
Koreans possess a true alphabet of 28 letters,
which, however, is not a local invention, as is
sometimes asserted. It appears to have been introduced by
the Buddhist monks about or before the tenth century, and to
be based on some cursive form of the Indian (Devanagari)
system<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>, although scarcely any resemblance can now be traced
between the two alphabets. This script is little used except
by the lower classes and the women, the <i>literati</i> preferring to
write either in Chinese, or else in the so-called <i>nido</i>, that is, an
adaptation of the Chinese symbols to the phonetic expression
of the Korean syllables. The <i>nido</i> is exactly analogous to the
Japanese <i>Katakana</i> script, in which modified forms of Chinese
ideographs are used phonetically to express 47 syllables (the
so-called <i>I-ro-fa</i> syllabary), raised to 73 by the <i>nigori</i> and <i>maru</i>
diacritical marks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Japanese.</div>

<p>The present population of Japan, according to E. Baelz,
shows the following types. The first and most important is the
Manchu-Korean type, characteristic of North
China and Korea, and most frequent among the
upper classes in Japan. The stature is conspicuously tall, the
effect being heightened by slender and elegant figure. The
face is long, with more or less oblique eyes but no marked
prominence of the cheek-bones. The nose is aquiline, the chin
slightly receding. With this type is associated a narrow chest,
giving an air of elegance rather than of muscularity, an effect
which is enhanced by the extremely delicate hands with long
slender fingers. The second type is the Mongol, and presents
a distinct contrast, with strong and squarely built figure, broad
face, prominent cheek-bones, oblique eyes, flat nose and wide
mouth. This type is not common in the Japanese Islands.
The third type, more conspicuous than either of the preceding,
is the Malay. The stature is small, with well-knit frame, and
broad, well-developed chest. The face is generally round, the
nose short, jaws and chin frequently projecting. None of these
three types represents the aboriginal race of Japan, for there
seems to be no doubt that the Ainu, who now survive in parts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
of the northern island of Yezo, occupied a greater area in earlier
times and to them the prehistoric shell-mounds and other
remains are usually attributed<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>. The Ainu are thickly and
strongly built, but differ from all other Oriental types in the
hairiness of face and body. The head is long, with a cephalic
index of 77.8. Face and nose are broad, and the eyes are horizontal,
not oblique, lacking the Mongolian fold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origins&mdash;Constituent
Elements.</div>

<p>It is generally assumed that this population represents the
easterly migration of that long-headed type which can be traced
across the continents of Europe and Asia in the
Stone Age, and that their entrance into the
islands was effected at a time when the channel
separating them from the mainland was neither so wide nor so
deep as at the present time. Later Manchu-Korean invaders
from the West, Mongols from the South, and Malays from the
East pressed the aborigines further and further north, to Yezo,
Sakhalin and the Kuriles. But it is possible that the Ainu
were not the earliest inhabitants of Japan, for they themselves
bear witness to predecessors, the <i>Koro-pok-guru</i>, mentioned
above (p. 260). Neither is the assumption of kinship between
the Ainu and prehistoric populations of Western Europe
accepted without demur. Deniker, while acknowledging the
resemblance to certain European types, classes the Ainu as a
separate race, the <i>Palaeasiatics</i>. For while in head-length,
prominent superciliary ridges, hairiness and the form of the nose
they may be compared to Russians, Todas, and Australians,
their skin colour, prominent cheek-bones, and other somatic
features make any close affinity impossible<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Japanese Type.</div>

<p>In spite of these various ingredients the Japanese people may
be regarded as fairly homogeneous. Apart from some tall and
robust persons amongst the upper classes, and
athletes, acrobats, and wrestlers, the general impression
that the Japanese are a short finely moulded race is fully
borne out by the now regularly recorded military measurements
of recruits, showing for height an average of 1.585 m. (5 ft. 2&frac12; in.)
to 1.639 m. (5 ft. 4&frac12; in.), for chest 33 in., and disproportionately
short legs. Other distinctive characters, all tending to stamp
a certain individuality on the people, taken as a whole and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
irrespective of local peculiarities, are a flat forehead, great
distance between the eyebrows, a very small nose with raised
nostrils, no glabella, no perceptible nasal root<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>; an active, wiry
figure; the exposed skin less yellow than the Chinese, and rather
inclining to a light fawn, but the covered parts very light, some
say even white; the eyes also less oblique, and all other characteristically
Mongol features generally softened, except the black
lank hair, which in transverse section is perhaps even rounder
than that of most other Mongol peoples<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Japanese and
Liu-Kiu
Islanders.</div>

<p>With this it will be instructive to compare F. H. H. Guillemard's
graphic account of the Liu-Kiu islanders, whose Koreo-Japanese
affinities are now placed beyond all doubt: "They
are a short race, probably even shorter than the Japanese, but
much better proportioned, being without the long bodies and
short legs of the latter people, and having as a rule extremely
well-developed chests. The colour of the skin varies of course
with the social position of the individual. Those who work in
the fields, clad only in a waist-cloth, are nearly as dark as a
Malay, but the upper classes are much fairer, and are at the
same time devoid of any of the yellow tint of the Chinaman.
To the latter race indeed they cannot be said to bear any resemblance,
and though the type is much closer to the Japanese,
it is nevertheless very distinct.... In Liu-Kiu the Japanese and
natives were easily recognised by us from the first, and must
therefore be possessed of very considerable differences.
The Liu-Kiuan has the face less flattened,
the eyes are more deeply set, and the nose more
prominent at its origin. The forehead is high and the cheek-bones
somewhat less marked than in the Japanese; the eyebrows
are arched and thick, and the eyelashes long. The
expression is gentle and pleasing, though somewhat sad, and
is apparently a true index of their character<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>."</p>

<p>This description is not accepted without some reserve by
Chamberlain, who in fact holds that "the physical type of the
Luchuans resembles that of the Japanese almost to identity<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>."
In explanation however of the singularly mild, inoffensive, and
"even timid disposition" of the Liu-Kiuans, this observer
suggests "the probable absence of any admixture of Malay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
blood in the race<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>." But everybody admits a Malay element
in Japan. It would therefore appear that Guillemard must be
right, and that, as even shown by all good photographs, differences
do exist, due in fact to the presence of this very Malay
strain in the Japanese race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Languages
and Religions.</div>

<p>Elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> Chamberlain has given us a scholarly account
of the Liu-Kiu language, which is not merely a "sister," as he
says, but obviously an <i>elder</i> sister, more archaic
in structure and partly in its phonetics, than the
oldest known form of Japanese. In the verb, for
instance, Japanese retains only one past tense of the indicative,
with but one grammatical form, whereas Liu-Kiuan preserves
the three original past tenses, each of which possesses a five-fold
inflection. All these racial, linguistic, and even mental
resemblances, such as the fundamental similarity of many of
their customs and ways of thought, he would explain with much
probability by the routes followed by the first emigrants from
the mainland. While the great bulk spread east and north
over the great archipelago, everywhere "driving the aborigines
before them," a smaller stream may have trended southward
to the little southern group, whose islets stretch like stepping-stones
the whole way from Japan to Great Liu-Kiu<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cult of the
Dead.</div>

<p>Amongst the common mental traits, mention is made of the
Shinto religion, "the simplest and most rustic form" of which
still survives in Liu-Kiu. Here, as in Japan, it
was originally a rude system of nature-worship,
the normal development of which was arrested
by Chinese and Buddhist influences. Later it became associated
with spirit-worship, the spirits being at first the souls of the
dead, and although there is at present no cult of the dead, in the
strict sense of the expression, the Liu-Kiu islanders probably
pay more respect to the departed than any other people in the
world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shintoism.</div>

<p>In Japan, Shintoism, as reformed in recent times, has become
much more a political institution than a religious system.
The <i>Kami-no-michi</i>, that is, the Japanese form
of the Chinese <i>Shin-to</i>, "way of the Gods," or
"spirits," is not merely the national faith, but is inseparably
bound up with the interests of the reigning dynasty, holding
the Mikado to be the direct descendant of the Sun-goddess<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
Hence its three cardinal precepts now are:&mdash;1. Honour the
<i>Kami</i> (spirits), of whom the emperor is the chief representative
on earth; 2. Revere him as thy sovereign; 3. Obey the will
of his Court, and that is the whole duty of man. There is
no moral code, and loyal expositors have declared that the
Mikado's will is the only test of right and wrong.</p>

<p>But apart from this political exegesis, Shintoism in its higher
form may be called a cultured deism, in its lower a "blind
obedience to governmental and priestly dictates<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>." There are
dim notions about a supreme creator, immortality, and even
rewards and penalties in the after-life. Some also talk vaguely,
as a pantheist might, of a sublime being or essence pervading
all nature, too vast and ethereal to be personified or addressed
in prayer, identified with the <i>tenka</i>, "heavens," from which all
things emanate, to which all return. Yet, although a personal
deity seems thus excluded, there are Shinto temples, apparently
for the worship of the heavenly bodies and powers of nature,
conceived as self-existing personalities&mdash;the so-called <i>Kami</i>,
"spirits," "gods," of which there are "eight millions," that is,
they are countless.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buddhism.</div>

<p>One cannot but suspect that some of these notions have
been grafted on the old national faith by Buddhism, which
was introduced about 550 <small>A.D.</small> and for a time had
great vogue. It was encouraged especially by
the Shoguns, or military usurpers of the Mikado's<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> functions,
obviously as a set-off against the Shinto theocracy. During
their tenure of power (1192-1868 <small>A.D.</small>) the land was covered
with Buddhist shrines and temples, some of vast size and quaint
design, filled with hideous idols, huge bells, and colossal statues
of Buddha.</p>

<p>But with the fall of the Shogun the little prestige still enjoyed
by Buddhism came to an end, and the temples, spoiled
of their treasures, have more than ever become the resort of
pleasure-seekers rather than of pious worshippers. "To all
the larger temples are attached regular spectacles, playhouses,
panoramas, besides lotteries, games of various sorts, including
the famous 'fan-throwing,' and shooting-galleries, where the
bow and arrow and the blow-pipe take the place of the rifle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
The accumulated treasures of the priests have been confiscated,
the monks driven from their monasteries, and many of these
buildings converted into profane uses. Countless temple bells
have already found their way to America, or have been sold
for old metal<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>."</p>

<p>Besides these forms of belief, there is a third religious, or
rather philosophic system, the so-called <i>Siza</i>, based on the
ethical teachings of Confucius, a sort of refined materialism,
such as underlies the whole religious thought of the nation.
Siza, always confined to the <i>literati</i>, has in recent years found
a formidable rival in the "English Philosophy," represented
by such writers as Buckle, Mill, Herbert Spencer, Darwin, and
Huxley, most of whose works have already been translated
into Japanese.</p>

<p>Thus this highly gifted people are being assimilated to the
western world in their social and religious, as well as their
political institutions. Their intellectual powers, already tested
in the fields of war, science, diplomacy, and self-government,
are certainly superior to those of all other Asiatic peoples, and
this is perhaps the best guarantee for the stability of the stupendous
transformation that a single generation has witnessed
from an exaggerated form of medieval feudalism to a political
and social system in harmony with the most advanced phases
of modern thought. The system has doubtless not yet penetrated
to the lower strata, especially amongst the rural populations.
But their natural receptivity, combined with a singular
freedom from "insular prejudice," must ensure the ultimate
acceptance of the new order by all classes of the community.</p>

in contradistinction to "Sumer" (Lowland). It should be noted that neither
Akkad nor Sumer occurs in the oldest texts, where Akkad is called <i>Kish</i> from the
name of its capital, and Sumer <i>Kiengi</i> (<i>Kengi</i>), probably a general name meaning
"the land." Kish has been identified with the Kush of Gen. x., one of the best
abused words in Palethnology. For this identification, however, there is some
ground, seeing that Kush is mentioned in the closest connection with "Babel, and
Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar" (Mesopotamia) <i>v.</i> 10.</p></div>

of Susiana speaking, not the standard Neo-Persian, but dialects of the ruder
Kurdish branch of the Iranian family, as if they had been Aryanised from Media,
the capital of which was Ekbatana. We have here, perhaps, a clue to the origin
of the Medes themselves, who were certainly the above-mentioned Mandas of
Nabonidus, their capital being also the same Ekbatana. Now Sayce (<i>Academy</i>,
Sept. 7, 1895, p. 189) identified the Kimmerians with these Manda nomads, whose
king Tukdamm&eacute; (Tugdamm&eacute;) was the Lygdanis of Strabo (<small>I</small>. 3, 16), who led a
horde of Kimmerians into Lydia and captured Sardis. We know from Esarhaddon's
inscriptions that by the Assyrians these Kimmerians were called Manda,
their prince Teupsa (Teispe) being described as "of the people of the Manda."
An oracle given to Esar-haddon begins: "The Kimmerian in the mountains has
set fire in the land of Ellip," <i>i.e.</i> the land where Ekbatana was afterwards founded,
which is now shown to have already been occupied by the Kimmerian or Manda
hordes. It follows that Kimmerians, Mandas, Medes with their modern Kurd and
Bakhtiari representatives, were all one people, who were almost certainly of Aryan
speech, if not actually of proto-Aryan stock. "The Kurds are the descendants of
Aryan invaders and have maintained their type and their language for more than
3300 years," F. v. Luschan, "The Early Inhabitants of Western Asia," <i>Journ. Roy.
Anthr. Inst.</i> <small>XLI.</small> 1911, p. 230. For a classification of Kurds see Mark Sykes, "The
Kurdish Tribes of the Ottoman Empire," <i>Journ. Roy. Anthr. Inst.</i> <small>XXXVIII.</small> 1908,

In the Chinese records they are referred to under the name of <i>I-lu</i> so early as

rivers on the one hand and the Pacific Ocean on the other, and paid tribute in

many of whom average nearly six feet in height. But there is an extraordinary
disparity between the two sexes, perhaps greater than in any other country. The
much smaller stature and feebler constitution of the women is no doubt due to the
detestable custom of crippling the feet in childhood, thereby depriving them of
natural exercise during the period of growth. It may be noted that the anti-foot-bandaging
movement is making progress throughout China, the object being to
abolish the cruel practice by making the <i>kin lien</i> ("golden lilies") unfashionable,
and the <i>ti mien</i>, the "heavenly feet,"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the natural&mdash;popular in their stead.</p></div>

is strange to reflect that the ethnological relations were thus profoundly disturbed
throughout the eastern hemisphere by the work of a ruthless despot who reigned
only twelve years, and in that time waged war against all the best traditions of the

<div class="sidenote">The Finno-Turki
Peoples.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Assimilation to
the Caucasic
Type.</div>

<p>In a very broad way all the western branches of the North
Mongol division may be comprised under the collective designation
of Finno-Turki Mongols. Jointly they
constitute a well-marked section of the family,
being distinguished from the eastern section by
several features which they have in common, and the most
important of which is unquestionably a much larger infusion
of Caucasic blood than is seen in any of the Mongolo-Tungusic
groups. So pronounced is this feature amongst many Finnish
as well as Turkish peoples, that some anthropologists have felt
inclined to deny any direct connection between the eastern
and western divisions of Mongolian man and to regard the
Baltic Finns, for instance, rather as "Allophylian Whites"
than as original members of the yellow race. Prichard, to
whom we owe this now nearly obsolete term
"Allophylian," held this view<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a>, and even Sayce
is "more than doubtful whether we can class the
Mongols physiologically with the Turkish-Tatars [the Turki
peoples], or the Ugro-Finns<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>It may, indeed, be allowed that at present the great majority
of the Finno-Turki populations occupy a position amongst the
varieties of mankind which is extremely perplexing for the
strict systematist. When the whole division is brought under
survey, every shade of transition is observed between the
Siberian Samoyeds of the Finnic branch and the steppe Kirghiz
of the Turki branch on the one hand, both of whom show
Mongol characters in an exaggerated form, and on the other
the Osmanli Turks and Hungarian Magyars, most of whom
may be regarded as typical Caucasians. Moreover, the difficulty
is increased by the fact, already pointed out, that these
mixed Mongolo-Caucasic characters occur not only amongst
the late historic groups, but also amongst the earliest known
groups&mdash;"Chudes," Usuns, Uigurs and others&mdash;who may be
called Proto-Finnish and Proto-Turki peoples. But precisely
herein lies the solution of the problem. Most of the region
now held by Turki and Finnish nations was originally occupied
by long-headed Caucasic men of the late Stone Ages (see
above). Then followed the Proto-Mongol intruders from the
Tibetan table-land, who partly submerged, partly intermingled
with their neolithic neighbours, many thus acquiring those
mixed characters by which they have been distinguished from
the earliest historic times. Later, further interminglings took
place according as the Finno-Turki hordes, leaving their original
seats in the Altai and surrounding regions, advanced westwards
and came more and more into contact with the European
populations of Caucasic type.</p>

<p>We may therefore conclude that the majority of the Finno-Turki
were almost from the first a somewhat mixed race, and
that during historic times the original Mongol element has
gradually yielded to the Caucasic in the direction from east to
west. Such is the picture now presented by these heterogeneous
populations, who in their primeval eastern seats are still mostly
typical Mongols, but have been more and more assimilated to
the European type in their new Anatolian, Baltic, Danubian,
and Balkan homes.</p>

<p>Observant travellers have often been impressed by this
progressive conformity of the Mongolo-Turki to Europeans.
During his westward journey through Central Asia Younghusband,
on passing from Mongolia to Eastern Turkestan,
found that the people, though tall and fine-looking, had at
first more of the Mongol cast of feature than he had expected.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
"Their faces, however, though somewhat round, were slightly
more elongated than the Mongol, and there was considerably
more intelligence about them. But there was more roundness,
less intelligence, less sharpness in the outlines than is seen in
the inhabitants of Kashgar and Yarkand." Then he adds:
"As I proceeded westwards I noticed a gradual, scarcely perceptible,
change from the round of a Mongolian type to a
sharper and yet more sharp type of feature.... As we get farther
away from Mongolia, we notice that the faces become gradually
longer and narrower; and farther west still, among some of
the inhabitants of Afghan Turkestan, we see that the Tartar
or Mongol type of feature is almost entirely lost<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>." To complete
the picture it need only be added that still further west,
in Asia Minor, the Balkan Peninsula, Hungary, and Finland,
the Mongol features are often entirely lost. "The Turks of
the west have so much Aryan and Semitic blood in them,
that the last vestiges of their original physical characters have
been lost, and their language alone indicates their previous
descent<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Turki Cradle.</div>

<p>Before they were broken up and dispersed over half
the northern hemisphere by Mongol pressure from the east,
the primitive Turki tribes dwelt, according to
Howorth, mainly between the Ulugh-dagh mountains
and the Orkhon river in Mongolia, that is, along the
southern slopes and spurs of the Altai-Sayan system from the
head waters of the Irtysh to the valleys draining north to Lake
Baikal. But the Turki cradle is shifted farther east by Richthofen,
who thinks that their true home lay between the Amur,
the Lena, and the Selenga, where at one time they had their
camping-grounds in close proximity to their Mongol and
Tungus kinsmen. There is nothing to show that the Yakuts,
who are admittedly of Turki stock, ever migrated to their
present northern homes in the Lena basin, which has more
probably always been their native land<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>.</p>

<p>But when they come within the horizon of history the Turki
are already a numerous nation, with a north-western and south-eastern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
division<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>, which may well have jointly occupied the
whole region from the Irtysh to the Lena, and both views may
thus be reconciled. In any case the Turki domain lay west of
the Mongol, and the Altai uplands, taken in the widest sense,
may still be regarded as the most probable zone of specialisation
for the Turki physical type. The typical characteristics are a
yellowish white complexion, a high brachycephalic head, often
almost cuboid, due to parieto-occipital flattening (especially
noticeable among the Yakuts), an elongated oval face, with
straight, somewhat prominent nose, and non-Mongolian eyes.
The stature is moderate, with an average of 1.675 m. (5 ft.
6 in.), and a tendency to stoutness.</p>

<p>Intermediate between the typical Turki and the Mongols
Hamy places the Uzbegs, Kirghiz, Bashkirs, and Nogais; and
between the Turks and Finns those extremely mixed groups
of East Russia commonly but wrongly called "Tartars," as
well as other transitions between Turk, Slav, Greek, Arab,
Osmanli of Constantinople, Kurugli of Algeria and others,
whose study shows the extreme difficulty of accurately determining
the limits of the Yellow and the White races<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>.</p>

<p>Analogous difficulties recur in the study of the Northern
(Siberian) groups&mdash;Samoyeds, Ostyaks, Voguls and other
Ugrians&mdash;who present great individual variations, leading
almost without a break from the Mongol to the Lapp, from the
Lapp to the Finn, from Finn to Slav and Teuton. Thus may
be shown a series of observations continuous between the most
typical Mongol, and those aberrant Mongolo-Caucasic groups
which answer to Prichard's "Allophylian races." Thus also is
confirmed by a study of details the above broad generalisation
in which I have endeavoured to determine the relation of the
Finno-Turki peoples to the primary Mongol and Caucasic
divisions.</p>

<p>Peisker's description of the Scythian invasions of Irania<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>
may be taken as typical of the whole area, and explains the
complexity of the ethnological problems. The
steppes and deserts of Central Asia are an impassable
barrier for the South Asiatics, the Aryans,
but not for the North Asiatic, the Altaian; for him they are
an open country, providing him with the indispensable winter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>pastures. On the other hand, for the South Asiatic Aryan
these deserts are an object of terror, and besides he is not
impelled towards them as he has winter pastures near at hand.
It is this difference in the distance of summer and winter pastures
that makes the North Asiatic Altaian an ever-wandering
herdsman, and the grazing part of the Indo-European race
cattle-rearers settled in limited districts. Thus, while the native
Iranian must halt before the trackless region of steppes and
deserts and cannot follow the well-mounted robber-nomad
thither, Iran itself is the object of greatest longing to the
nomadic Altaian. Here he can plunder and enslave to his
heart's delight, and if he succeeds in maintaining himself for a
considerable time among the Aryans, he learns the language
of the subjugated people and, by mingling with them, loses his
Mongol characteristics more and more. If the Iranian is now
fortunate enough to shake off the yoke, the dispossessed iranised
Altaian intruder inflicts himself upon other lands. So it was
with the Scythians. Leaving their families behind in the South
Russian steppes, the Scythians invaded Media <i>c.</i> <small>B.C.</small> 630, and
advanced into Mesopotamia as far as Egypt.</p>

<p>In Media they took Median wives and learned the
Median language. After being driven out by Cyaxares, on
their return, some 28 years later, they met with a new generation,
the offspring of the wives and daughters whom they had
left behind, and slaves of an alien race. A hundred and fifty
years later Hippocrates remarked their yellowish red complexion,
corpulence, smooth skins, and their consequent eunuch-like
appearance&mdash;all typically Mongol characteristics. Hippocrates
was the most celebrated physician and natural philosopher
of the ancient world. His evidence is unshakeable and cannot
be invalidated by the Aryan speech of the Scythians. Their
Mongol type was innate in them, whereas their Iranian speech
was acquired and is no refutation of Hippocrates' testimony.
On the later Greek vases from South Russian excavations they
already appear strongly demongolised and the Altaian is only suggested by
their hair, which is as stiff as a horse's mane&mdash;hence Aristotle's epithet
<span class = "greek" title = "euthytriches">&#949;&#8016;&#952;&#973;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#967;&#949;&#962;</span>&mdash;the characteristic that survives
longest among all Ural-Altaian hybrid peoples.</p>

<p>E. H. Parker unfortunately lent the weight of his authority
to the statement that the word "T&uuml;rk&ouml;" [Turki] "goes no
farther back than the fifth century of our era," and that "so far
as recorded history is concerned the name of Turk dates from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>this time<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>." But Turki tribes bearing this national name had
penetrated into East Europe hundreds of years before that time,
and were already seated on the Tanais (Don) about the new
era. They are mentioned by name both by Pomponius Mela<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>
and by Pliny<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a>, and to the same connection belonged, beyond
all doubt, the warlike <i>Parthians</i>, who 300 years
earlier were already seated on the confines of Iran
and Turan, routed the legions of Crassus and
Antony, and for five centuries (250 <small>B.C.</small>-229 <small>A.D.</small>) usurped
the throne of the "King of Kings," holding sway from the
Euphrates to the Ganges, and from the Caspian to the Indian
Ocean. Direct descendants of the Parthians are the fierce
Turkoman nomads, who for ages terrorised over all the settled
populations encircling the Aralo-Caspian depression. Their
power has at last been broken by the Russians, but they are
still politically dominant in Persia<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a>. They have thus been for
many ages in the closest contact with Caucasic Iranians, with
the result that the present Turkoman type is shown by
J. L. Yavorsky's observations to be extremely variable<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dahae, J&aacute;t, and

<p>Both the Parthians and the <i>Massagetae</i> have been identified
with the <i>Yu&eacute;-chi</i>, who figured so largely in the annals of the
Han dynasties, and are above mentioned as
having been driven west to Sungaria by the
Hiung-nu after the erection of the Great Wall.
It has been said that, could we follow the peregrinations of the
Yu&eacute;-chi bands from their early seats at the foot of the Kinghan
mountains to their disappearance amid the snows of the Western
Himalayas, we should hold the key to the solution of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>obscure problems associated with the migrations of the Mongolo-Turki
hordes since the torrent of invasion was diverted
westwards by Shih Hwang Ti's mighty barrier. One point,
however, seems clear enough, that the Yu&eacute;-chi were a different
people both from the Parthians who had already occupied
Hyrcania (Khorasan) at least in the third century <small>B.C.</small>, if not
earlier, and from the Massagetae. For the latter were seated
on the Yaxartes (Sir-darya) in the time of Cyrus (sixth century
<small>B.C.</small>), whereas the Yu&eacute;-chi still dwelt east of Lake Lob (Tarim
basin) in the third century. After their defeat by the Hiung-nu
and the Usuns (201 and 165 <small>B.C.</small>), they withdrew to Sogdiana
(Transoxiana), reduced the <i>Ta-Hia</i> of Baktria, and in 126 <small>B.C.</small>
overthrew the Graeco-Baktrian kingdom, which
had been founded after the death of Alexander towards
the close of the fourth century. But in the
Kabul valley, south of the Hindu-Kush, the Greeks still held
their ground for over 100 years, until Kadphises I., king of the
Kushans&mdash;a branch of the Yu&eacute;-chi&mdash;after uniting the whole
nation in a single Indo-Scythian state, extended his conquests
to Kabul and succeeded Hermaeus, last of the Greek dynasty
(40-20 <small>B.C.</small>?). Kadphises' son Kadaphes (10 <small>A.D.</small>) added to
his empire a great part of North India, where his successors
of the Yu&eacute;-chi dynasty reigned from the middle of the first to
the end of the fourth century <small>A.D.</small> Here they are supposed by
some authorities to be still represented by the
<i>J&aacute;ts</i> and <i>R&aacute;jputs</i>, and even Prichard allows that
the supposition "does not appear altogether preposterous,"
although "the physical characters of the J&aacute;ts are
very different from those attributed to the Yuetschi [Yu&eacute;-chi]
and the kindred tribes [Suns, Kushans, etc.] by the writers
cited by Klaproth and Abel Remusat, who say that they are
of sanguine complexion with blue eyes<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>."</p>

<p>We now know that these characters present little difficulty
when the composite origin of the Turki people is borne in mind.
On the other hand it is interesting to note that the above-mentioned
Ta-Hia have by some been identified with the warlike
Scythian Dahae<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>, and these with the Dehiya or Dh&eacute; one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
the great divisions of the Indian J&aacute;ts. But if Rawlinson<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> is right,
the term <i>Dahae</i> was not racial but social, meaning <i>rustici</i>,&mdash;the
peasantry as opposed to the nomads; hence the Dahae are
heard of everywhere throughout Irania, just as <i>Dehwar</i><a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> is still
the common designation of the Tajik (Persian) peasantry in
Afghanistan and Baluchistan. This is also the view taken by
de Ujfalvy, who identifies the Ta-Hia, not with the Scythian
Dahae, or with any other particular tribe, but with the peaceful
rural population of Baktriana<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>, whose reduction by the Yu&eacute;-chi,
possibly Strabo's Tokhari, was followed by the overthrow of
the Graeco-Baktrians. The solution of the puzzling Yu&eacute;-chi-J&aacute;t
problem would therefore seem to be that the Dehiya and
other J&aacute;ts, always an agricultural people, are descended from
the old Iranian peasantry of Baktriana, some of whom followed
the fortunes of their Greek rulers into Kabul valley, while others
accompanied the conquering Yu&eacute;-chi founders of the Indo-Scythian
empire into northern India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The "White
Huns."</div>

<p>Then followed the overthrow of the Yu&eacute;-chi themselves by
the <i>Y&eacute;-tha</i> (<i>Ye-tha-i-li-to</i>) of the Chinese records, that is, the
<i>Ephthalites</i>, or so-called "White Huns," of the Greek and Arab
writers, who about 425 <small>A.D.</small> overran Transoxiana,
and soon afterwards penetrated through the mountain
passes into the Kabul and Indus valleys.
Although confused by some contemporary writers (Zosimus,
Am. Marcellinus) with Attila's Huns, M. Drouin has made it
clear that the Y&eacute;-tha were not Huns (Mongols) at all, but, like
the Yu&eacute;-chi, a Turki people, who were driven westwards about
the same time as the Hiung-nu by the Yuan-yuans (see above).
Of Hun they had little but the name, and the more accurate
Procopius was aware that they differed entirely from "the
Huns known to us, not being nomads, but settled for a long
time in a fertile region." He speaks also of their white colour
and regular features, and their sedentary life<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> as in the Chinese
accounts, where they are described as warlike conquerors of
twenty kingdoms, as far as that of the A-si (Arsacides, Parthians),
and in their customs resembling the Tu-Kiu (Turks),
being in fact "of the same race." On the ruins of the Indo-Scythian
(Yu&eacute;-chi) empire, the White Huns ruled in India<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
and the surrounding lands from 425 to the middle of the sixth
century. A little later came the Arabs, who in 706 captured
Samarkand, and under the Abassides were supreme in Central
Asia till scattered to the winds by the Oghuz Turki hordes.</p>

<p>From all this it has been suggested that&mdash;while the Baktrian
peasants entered India as settlers, and are now represented by
the agricultural J&aacute;ts&mdash;the Yu&eacute;-chi and Y&eacute;-tha, both of fair
Turki stock, came as conquerors, and are now represented by
the R&aacute;jputs, "Sons of Kings," the warrior and land-owning
race of northern India. It is significant that these Th&aacute;kur,
"feudal lords," mostly trace their genealogies from about the beginning
of the seventh century, as if they had become Hinduized
soon after the fall of the foreign Y&eacute;-tha dynasty, while on the
other hand "the country legends abound with instances of the
conflict between the R&aacute;jput and the Br&aacute;hman in prehistoric
times<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>." This supports the conjecture that the R&aacute;jputs entered
India, not as "Aryans" of the Kshatriya or military caste, as
is commonly assumed, but as aliens (Turki), the avowed foes
of the true Aryans, that is, the Br&aacute;hman or theocratic (priestly)
caste. Thus also is explained the intimate association of the
R&aacute;jputs and the J&aacute;ts from the first&mdash;the R&aacute;jputs being the
Turki leaders of the invasions; and the J&aacute;ts their peaceful
Baktrian subjects following in their wake.</p>

<p>The theory that the haughty R&aacute;jputs are of unsullied
"Aryan blood" is scarcely any longer held even by the R&aacute;jputs
themselves; they are undoubtedly of mixed origin. But the
definite physical type which H. H. Risley<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> describes as characteristic
of R&aacute;jputs and J&aacute;ts in the Kashmir Valley, Punjab
and Rajputana, shows them to be wavy-haired dark-skinned
dolichocephals, linked rather with the "Caucasic" than the
"Mongolian" division.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Uigurs.</div>

<p>Nearly related to the White Huns were the <i>Uigurs</i>, the
<i>Kao-che</i> of the Chinese annals, who may claim to be the first
Turki nation that founded a relatively civilised
State in Central Asia. Before the general commotion
caused by the westward pressure of the Hiung-nu, they
appear to have dwelt in eastern Turkestan (Kashgaria) between
the Usuns and the Sacae, and here they had already made
considerable progress under Buddhist influences about the
fourth or fifth century of the new era. Later, the Buddhist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
missionaries from Tibet were replaced by Christian (Nestorian)
evangelists from western Asia, who in the seventh century
reduced the Uigur language to written form, adapting for the
purpose the Syriac alphabet, which was afterwards borrowed
by the Mongols and the Manchus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Orkhon
Inscriptions.</div>

<p>This Syriac script&mdash;which, as shown by the authentic inscription
of Si-ngan-fu, was introduced into China in 635 <small>A.D.</small>&mdash;is
not to be confused with that of the Orkhon inscriptions<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>
dating from 732 <small>A.D.</small>, and bearing a certain resemblance to
some of the Runic characters, as also to the Korean, at least in
form, but never in sound. Yet although differing
from the Uiguric, Prof. Thomsen, who has successfully
deciphered the Orkhon text, thinks that
this script may also be derived, at least indirectly through some
of the Iranian varieties, from the same Aramean (Syriac) form
of the Semitic alphabet that gave birth to the Uiguric<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>.</p>

<p>It is more important to note that all the non-Chinese inscriptions
are in the Turki language, while the Chinese text
refers by name to the father, the grandfather, and the great-grandfather
of the reigning Khan Bilga, which takes us back
nearly to the time when Sinjibu (Dizabul), Great Khan of the
Altai Turks, was visited by the Byzantine envoy, Zimarchus,
in 569 <small>A.D.</small> In the still extant report of this embassy<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> the Turks
(<span class = "greek" title = "Tourkoi">&#932;&#959;&#8166;&#961;&#954;&#959;&#953;</span>) are mentioned by name, and are described as nomads
who dwelt in tents mounted on wagons, burnt the dead, and
raised to their memory monuments, statues, and cairns with
as many stones as the foes slain by the deceased in battle. It
is also stated that they had a peculiar writing system, which
must have been that of these Orkhon inscriptions, the Uiguric
having apparently been introduced somewhat later.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>Originally the Uigurs comprised nineteen clans, which at
a remote period already formed two great sections:&mdash;the On-Uigur
("Ten Uigurs") in the south, and the Toghuz-Uigur
("Nine Uigurs") in the north. The former had penetrated
westwards to the Aral Sea<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> as early as the second century <small>A.D.</small>,
and many of them undoubtedly took part in Attila's invasion
of Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Assena
Turki Dynasty.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Toghuz-Uigur
Empire.</div>

<p>Later, all these Western Uigurs, mentioned amongst the
hordes that harassed the Eastern Empire in the fifth and sixth
centuries, in association especially with the Turki Avars, disappear
from history, being merged in the Ugrian and other
Finnish peoples of the Volga basin. The Toghuz section also,
after throwing off the yoke of the Mongol or Tungus Geugen
(Jeu-Jen) in the fifth century, were for a time submerged
in the vast empire of the Altai Turks,
founded in 552 by Tumen of the House of Assena
(A-shi-na), who was the first to assume the title of Kha-Khan,
"Great Khan," and whose dynasty ruled over the united Turki
and Mongol peoples from the Pacific to the Caspian, and from
the Frozen Ocean to the confines of China and Tibet. Both the
above-mentioned Sinjibu, who received the Byzantine envoy,
and the Bilga Khan of the Orkhon <i>stele</i>, belonged to this
dynasty, which was replaced in 774 by Pei-lo (Huei-hu), chief
of the Toghuz-Uigurs. This is how we are to understand the
statement that all the Turki peoples who during the somewhat
unstable rule of the Assena dynasty from 552 to 774 had
undergone many vicissitudes, and about 580 were even broken
into two great sections (Eastern Turks of the Karakoram region
and Western Turks of the Tarim basin), were again united
in one vast political system under the Toghuz-Uigurs.
These are henceforth known in history
simply as Uigurs, the On branch having, as stated,
long disappeared in the West. The centre of their power seems
to have oscillated between Karakoram and Turfan in Eastern
Turkestan, the extensive ruins of which have been explored by
D. A. Klements, Sven Hedin and M. A. Stein. Their vast
dominions were gradually dismembered, first by the <i>Hakas</i>,
or <i>Ki-li-Kiss&eacute;</i>, precursors of the present Kirghiz, who overran
the eastern (Orkhon) districts about 840, and then by the
Muhammadans of M&aacute;war-en-Nahar (Transoxiana), who overthrew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
the "Lion Kings," as the Uigur Khans of Turfan were
called, and set up several petty Mussulman states in Eastern
Turkestan. Later they fell under the yoke of the Kara-Khitais,
and were amongst the first to join the devastating hordes of
Jenghiz-Khan; their name, which henceforth vanishes from history<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>,
has been popularly recognised under the form of "Ogres,"
in fable and nursery tales, but the derivation lacks historical
foundation.</p>

<p>At present the heterogeneous populations of the Tarim
basin (Kashgaria, Eastern Turkestan), where the various elements
have been intermingled, offer a striking contrast to those
of the Ili valley (Sungaria), where one invading horde has
succeeded and been superimposed on another. Hence the complexity
of the Kashgarian type, in which the original "horse-like
face" everywhere crops out, absorbing the later Mongolo-Turki
arrivals. But in Sungaria the Kalmuk, Chinese, Dungan,
Taranchi, and Kirghiz groups are all still sharply distinguished
and perceptible at a glance. "Amongst the Kashgarians&mdash;a
term as vague ethnically as 'Aryan'&mdash;Richthofen has determined
the successive presence of the Su, Yu&eacute;-chi, and Usun
hordes, as described in the early Chinese chronicles<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>."</p>

<p>The recent explorations of M. A. Stein have thrown some
light on the ethnology of this region, and a preliminary survey
of results was prepared and published by T. A. Joyce. He
concludes that the original inhabitants were of Alpine type,
with, in the west, traces of the Indo-Afghan, and that the
Mongolian has had very little influence upon the population<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Oghuz
Turks and their
Migrations.</div>

<p>In close proximity to the Toghuz-Uigurs dwelt the <i>Oghuz</i>
(<i>Ghuz, Uz</i>), for whom eponymous heroes have been provided
in the legendary records of the Eastern Turks, although all
these terms would appear to be merely shortened forms of
Toghuz<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a>. But whether true Uigurs, or a distinct branch of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>the Turki people, the Ghuz, as they are commonly called by
the Arab writers, began their westward migrations
about the year 780. After occupying Transoxiana,
where they are now represented by the
Uzbegs<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> of Bokhara and surrounding lands, they gradually
spread as conquerors over all the northern parts of Irania, Asia
Minor, Syria, the Russian and Caucasian steppes, Ukrainia,
Dacia, and the Balkan Peninsula. In most of these lands they
formed fresh ethnical combinations both with the Caucasic
aborigines, and with many kindred Turki as well as Mongol
peoples, some of whom were settled in these regions since
neolithic times, while others had either accompanied Attila's
expeditions, or followed in his wake (Pechenegs, Komans,
Alans, Kipchaks, Kara-Kalpaks), or else arrived later in company
with Jenghiz-Khan and his successors (Kazan and Nogai
"Tatars"<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>).</p>

<p>In Russia, Rumania (Dacia), and most of the Balkan Peninsula
these Mongolo-Turki blends have been again submerged
by the dominant Slav and Rumanian peoples (Great and Little
Russians, Servo-Croatians, Montenegrini, Moldavians, and
Walachians). But in south-western Asia they still constitute
perhaps the majority of the population between the Indus and
Constantinople, in many places forming numerous compact
communities, in which the Mongolo-Turki physical and mental
characters are conspicuous. Such, besides the already mentioned
Turkomans of Parthian lineage, are all the nomad and many
of the settled inhabitants of Khiva, Ferghana, Karategin, Bokhara,
generally comprised under the name of Uzbegs and
"Sartes." Such also are the Turki peoples of Afghan Turkestan,
and of the neighbouring uplands (Hazaras and Aimaks
who claim Mongol descent, though now of Persian speech); the
Aderbaijani and many other more scattered groups in Persia;
the Nogai and Kumuk tribes of Caucasia, and especially most
of the nomad and settled agricultural populations of Asia Minor.
The Anatolian peasantry form, in fact, the most numerous and
compact division of the Turki family still surviving in any part
of their vast domain between the Bosporus and the Lena.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Seljuks and
Osmanli.</div>

<p>Out of this prolific Oghuz stock arose many renowned chiefs,
founders of vast but somewhat unstable empires, such as those
of the Gasnevides, who ruled from Persia to the Indus; the
Seljuks, who first wrested the Asiatic provinces
from Byzantium; the Osmanli, so named from
Othman, the Arabised form of Athman, who prepared
the way for Orkhan (1326-60), true builder of the
Ottoman power, which has alone survived the shipwreck of
all the historical Turki states. The vicissitudes of these
monarchies, looked on perhaps with too kindly an eye by
Gibbon, belong to the domain of history, and it will suffice here
to state that from the ethnical standpoint the chief interest
centres in that of the Seljukides, covering the period from about
the middle of the eleventh to the middle of the thirteenth century.
It was under Togrul-beg of this dynasty (1038-63) that "the
whole body of the Turkish nation embraced with fervour and
sincerity the religion of Mahomet<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>." A little later began the
permanent Turki occupation of Asia Minor, where, after the
conquest of Armenia (1065-68) and the overthrow of the Byzantine
emperor Romanus Diogenes (1071), numerous military
settlements, followed by nomad Turkoman encampments, were
established by the great Seljuk rulers, Alp Arslan and Malek
Shah (1063-92), at all the strategical points. These first
arrivals were joined later by others fleeing before the Mongol
hosts led by Jenghiz-Khan's successors down to the time of
Timur-beg. But the Christians (Greeks and earlier aborigines)
were not exterminated, and we read that, while great numbers
apostatised, "many thousand children were marked by the
knife of circumcision; and many thousand captives were
devoted to the service or the pleasures of their masters" (<i>ib.</i>).
In other words, the already mixed Turki intruders were yet
more modified by further interminglings with the earlier inhabitants
of Asia Minor. Those who, following the fortunes
of the Othman dynasty, crossed the Bosporus and settled in
Rumelia and some other parts of the Balkan Peninsula, now
prefer to call themselves <i>Osmanli</i>, even repudiating the national
name "Turk" still retained with pride by the ruder peasant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
classes of Asia Minor. The latter are often spoken of as
"Seljuk Turks," as if there were some racial difference between
them and the European Osmanli, and for the distinction there
is some foundation. As pointed out by Arminius Vamb&eacute;ry<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>,
the Osmanli have been influenced and modified by their closer
association with the Christian populations of the Balkan lands,
while in Anatolia the Seljuks have been able better to preserve
the national type and temperament. The true Turki spirit
("das T&uuml;rkentum") survives especially in the provinces of
Lykaonia and Kappadokia, where the few surviving natives
were not only Islamised but ethnically fused, whereas in Europe
most of them (Bosnians, Albanians) were only Islamised, and
here the Turki element has always been slight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Yakuts.</div>

<p>At present the original Turki type and temperament are
perhaps best preserved amongst the remote <i>Yakuts</i> of the Lena,
and the <i>Kirghiz</i> groups (<i>Kirghiz Kazaks</i> and
<i>Kara Kirghiz</i>) of the West Siberian steppe and
the Pamir uplands. The Turki connection of the Yakuts, about
which some unnecessary doubts had been raised, has been set
at rest by V. A. Sierochevsky<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a>, who, however, describes them
as now a very mixed people, owing to alliances with the Tunguses
and Russians. They are of short stature, averaging
scarcely 5 ft. 4 in., and this observer thought their dark but not
brilliant black eyes, deeply sunk in narrow orbits, gave them
more of a Red Indian than of a Mongol cast. They are almost
the only progressive aboriginal people in Siberia, although
numbering not more than 200,000 souls, concentrated chiefly
along the river banks on the plateau between the Lena and the
Aldan.</p>

<p>In the Yakuts we have an extreme instance of the capacity
of man to adapt himself to the <i>milieu</i>. They not merely exist,
but thrive and display a considerable degree of energy and
enterprise in the coldest region on the globe. Within the
isothermal of -72&deg; Fahr., Verkhoyansk, in the heart of their
territory, is alone included, for the period from November to
February, and in this temperature, at which the quicksilver
freezes, the Yakut children may be seen gambolling naked in
the snow. In midwinter R. Kennan met some of these "men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
of iron," as Wrangel calls them, airily arrayed in nothing but
a shirt and a sheepskin, lounging about as if in the enjoyment
of the balmy zephyrs of some genial sub-tropical zone.</p>

<p>Although nearly all are Orthodox Christians, or at least
baptized as such, they are mere Shamanists at heart, still conjuring
the powers of nature, but offering no worship to a supreme
deity, of whom they have a vague notion, though he is too far
off to hear, or too good to need their supplications. The world
of good and evil spirits, however, has been enriched by accessions
from the Russian calendar and pandemonium. Thanks to their
commercial spirit, the Yakut language, a very pure Turki idiom,
is even more widespread than the race, having become a general
medium of intercourse for Tungus, Russian, Mongol and other
traders throughout East Siberia, from Irkutsk to the Sea of
Okhotsk, and from the Chinese frontier to the Arctic Ocean<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Kirghiz.</div>

<p>To some extent W. Radloff is right in describing the great
Kirghiz Turki family as "of all Turks most nearly allied to the
Mongols in their physical characters, and by their
family names such as Kyptshak [Kipchak], Argyn,
Naiman, giving evidence of Mongolian descent, or at least of
intermixture with Mongols<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>." But we have already been warned
against the danger of attaching too much importance to these
tribal designations, many of which seem, after acquiring renown
on the battle-field, to have passed readily from one ethnic group
to another. There are certain Hindu-Kush and Afghan tribes
who think themselves Greeks or Arabs, because of the supposed
descent of their chiefs from Alexander the Great or the Prophet's
family, and genealogical trees spring up like the conjurer's
mango plant in support of such illustrious lineage. The Chagatai
(Jagatai) tribes, of Turki stock and speech, take their
name from a full-blood Mongol, Chagatai, second son of
Jenghiz-Khan, to whom fell Eastern Turkestan in the partition
of the empire.</p>

<p>In the same way many Uzbeg and Kirghiz Turki tribes
are named from famous Mongol chiefs, although no one will
deny a strain of true Mongol blood in all these heterogeneous
groups. This is evident enough from the square and somewhat
flat Mongol features, prominent cheek-bones, oblique eyes,
large mouth, feet and hands, yellowish brown complexion, ungainly
obese figures and short stature, all of which are characteristic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
of both sections, the Kara-Kirghiz highlanders, and the
Kazaks of the lowlands. Some ethnologists regard these
Kirghiz groups, not as a distinct branch of the Mongolo-Turki
race, but rather as a confederation of several nomad tribes
stretching from the Gobi to the Lower Volga, and mingled
together by Jenghiz-Khan and his successors<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kaz&aacute;k and
Kossack.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Kara-Kirghiz.</div>

<p>The true national name is <i>Kaz&aacute;k</i>, "Riders," and as they
were originally for the most part mounted marauders, or free
lances of the steppe, the term came to be gradually
applied to all nomad and other horsemen engaged
in predatory warfare. It thus at an early date
reached the South Russian steppe, where it was adopted in
the form of <i>Kossack</i> by the Russians themselves. It should
be noted that the compound term Kirghiz-Kazak, introduced
by the Russians to distinguish these nomads from their own
Cossacks, is really a misnomer. The word
"Kirghiz," whatever its origin, is never used by
the Kazaks in reference to themselves, but only
to their near relations, the Kirghiz, or Kara-Kirghiz<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>, of the
uplands.</p>

<p>These highlanders, who roam the Tian-Shan and Pamir
valleys, form two sections:&mdash;<i>On</i>, "Right," or East, and <i>Sol</i>,
"Left," or West. They are the <i>Diko Kamennyi</i>, that is, "Wild
Rock People," of the Russians, whence the expression "Block
Kirghiz" still found in some English books of travel. But
they call themselves simply Kirghiz, claiming descent from an
original tribe of that name, itself sprung from a legendary
Kirghiz-beg, from whom are also descended the Chiliks, Kitars
and others, all now reunited with the Ons and the Sols.</p>

<p>The Kazaks also are grouped in long-established and still
jealously maintained sections&mdash;the <i>Great</i>, <i>Middle</i>, <i>Little</i>, and
<i>Inner Horde</i>&mdash;whose joint domain extends from Lake Balkash
round the north side of the Caspian down to the Lower
Volga<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>. All accepted the teachings of Islam many centuries
ago, but their Muhammadanism<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> is of a somewhat negative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
character, without mosques, mollahs, or fanaticism, and in
practice not greatly to be distinguished from the old Siberian
Shamanism. Kumiss, fermented mare's milk, their universal
drink, as amongst the ancient Scythians, plays a large part in
the life of these hospitable steppe nomads.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Finns.</div>

<p>One of the lasting results of Castr&egrave;n's labours has been to
place beyond reasonable doubt the Altai origin of the Finnish
peoples<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a>. Their cradle may now be localised with
some confidence about the head waters of the
Yenisei, in proximity to that of their Turki kinsmen. Here
is the seat of the <i>Soyotes</i> and of the closely allied <i>Koibals</i>,
<i>Kamassintzi</i>, <i>Matores</i>, <i>Karagasses</i> and others, who occupy a
considerable territory along both slopes of the Sayan range,
and may be regarded as the primitive stock of the widely diffused
Finnish race. Some of these groups have intermingled
with the neighbouring Turki peoples, and even speak Turki
dialects. But the original Finnish type and speech are well
represented by the Soyotes, who are here indigenous, and "from
these their ... kinsmen, the Samoyeds have spread as breeders
of reindeer to the north of the continent from the White Sea
to the Bay of Chatanga<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a>." Others, following a westerly route
along the foot of the Altai and down the Irtysh to the Urals,
appear to have long occupied both slopes of that range, where
they acquired some degree of culture, and especially that knowledge
of, and skill in working, the precious and other metals,
for which the "White-eyed Chudes" were famous, and to which
repeated reference is made in the songs of the <i>Kalevala</i><a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a>. As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
there are no mines or minerals in Finland itself, it seems obvious
that the legendary heroes of the Finnish national epic must
have dwelt in some metalliferous region, which could only be
the Altai or the Urals, possibly both.</p>

<p>In any case the Urals became a second home and point of
dispersion for the Finnish tribes (<i>Ugrian Finns</i>), whose migrations&mdash;some
prehistoric, some historic&mdash;can be followed thence
down the Pechora and Dvina to the Frozen Ocean<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>, and down
the Kama to the Volga. From this artery, where permanent
settlements were formed (<i>Volga Finns</i>), some conquering hordes
went south and west (<i>Danubian Finns</i>), while more peaceful
wanderers ascended the great river to Lakes Ladoga and
Onega, and thence to the shores of the Baltic and Lapland
(<i>Baltic and Lake Finns</i>).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Former and
Present
Domain.</div>

<p>Thus were constituted the main branches of the widespread
Finnish family, whose domain formerly extended from the
Katanga beyond the Yenisei to Lapland, and
from the Arctic Ocean to the Altai range, the
Caspian, and the Volga, with considerable <i>enclaves</i>
in the Danube basin. But throughout their relatively short
historic life the Finnish peoples, despite a characteristic tenacity
and power of resistance, have in many places been encroached
upon, absorbed, or even entirely eliminated, by more aggressive
races, such as the Siberian "Tatars" in their Altai cradleland,
the Turki Kirghiz and Bashkirs in the West Siberian steppes
and the Urals, the Russians in the Volga and Lake districts,
the Germans and Lithuanians in the Baltic Provinces (Kurland,
Livonia, Esthonia), the Rumanians, Slavs, and others in the
Danube regions, where the Ugrian Bulgars and Magyars have
been almost entirely assimilated in type (and the former also
in speech) to the surrounding European populations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Late Westward
Spread of
the Finns.</div>

<p>Few anthropologists now attach much importance to the
views not yet quite obsolete regarding a former extension of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>the Finnish race over the whole of Europe and the British
Isles.  Despite the fact that all the Finns are essentially
round-headed, they were identified first with the
long-headed cavemen, who retreated north with
the reindeer, as was the favourite hypothesis, and
then with the early neolithic races who were also long-headed.
Elaborate but now forgotten essays were written by learned
philologists to establish a common origin of the Basque and
the Finnic tongues, which have nothing in common, and half the
myths, folklore, and legendary heroes of the western nations
were traced to Finno-Ugrian sources.</p>

<p>Now we know better, and both archaeologists and philologists
have made it evident that the Finnish peoples are relatively
quite recent arrivals in Europe, that the men of the
Bronze Age in Finland itself were not Finns but Teutons, and
that at the beginning of the new era all the Finnish tribes still
dwelt east of the Gulf of Finland<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Iron and
Bronze Ages in
the Finnish
Lands.</div>

<p>Not only so, but the eastern migrations themselves, as
above roughly outlined, appear to have taken place at a relatively
late epoch, long after the inhabitants of
West Siberia had passed from the New Stone
to the Metal Ages.  J. R. Aspelin, "founder
of Finno-Ugrian archaeology," points out that
the Finno-Ugrian peoples originally occupied a geographical
position between the Indo-Germanic and the Mongolic races,
and that their first Iron Age was most probably a development,
between the Yenisei and the Kama, of the so-called Ural-Altai
Bronze Age, the last echoes of which may be traced westwards
to Finland and North Scandinavia.  In the Upper Yenisei
districts iron objects had still the forms of the Bronze Age,
when that ancient civilisation, associated with the name of the
"Chudes," was interrupted by an invasion which introduced
the still persisting Turki Iron Age, expelled the aboriginal
inhabitants, and thus gave rise to the great migrations first of
the Finno-Ugrians, and then of the Turki peoples (Bashkirs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
Volga "Tatars" and others) to and across the Urals. It was
here, in the Permian territory between the Irtysh and the Kama,
that the West Siberian (Chudish) Iron Age continued its normal
and unbroken evolution. The objects recovered from the old
graves and kurgans in the present governments of Tver and
Iaroslav, and especially at Ananyino on the Kama, centre of
this culture, show that here took place the transition from the
Bronze to the Iron Age some 300 years before the new era,
and here was developed a later Iron Age, whose forms are
characteristic of the northern Finno-Ugrian lands. The whole
region would thus appear to have been first occupied by these
immigrants from Asia after the irruption of the Turki hordes
into Western Siberia during the first Iron Age, at most some
500 or 600 years before the Christian era. The Finno-Ugrian
migrations are thus limited to a period of not more than 2600
years from the present time, and this conclusion, based on
archaeological grounds, agrees fairly well with the historical,
linguistic, and ethnical data.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Baltic
Finns.</div>

<p>It is especially in this obscure field of research that the
eminent Danish scholar, Vilhelm Thomsen, has rendered inestimable
services to European ethnology. By the light of his
linguistic studies A. H. Snellman<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> has elucidated
the origins of the Baltic Finns, the Proto-Esthonians,
the now all but extinct Livonians, and the
quite extinct Kurlanders, from the time when they still dwelt
east and south-east of the Baltic lands, under the influence of
the surrounding Lithuanian and Gothic tribes, till the German
conquest of the Baltic provinces. We learn from Jordanes, to
whom is due the first authentic account of these populations,
that the various Finnish tribes were subject to the Gothic king
Hermanarich, and Thomsen now shows that all the Western
Finns (Esthonians, Livonians, Votes, Vepses, Karelians,
Tavastians, and others of Finland) must in the first centuries
of the new era have lived practically as one people in the
closest social union, speaking one language, and following the
same religious, tribal, and political institutions. Earlier than
the Gothic was the Letto-Lithuanian contact, as shown by the
fact that its traces are perceptible in the language of the Volga
Finns, in which German loan-words are absent. From these
investigations it becomes clear that the Finnish domain must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
at that time have stretched from the present Esthonia, Livonia,
and Lake Ladoga south to the western Dvina.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relations to
Goths, Letts,
and Slavs.</div>

<p>The westward movement was connected with the Slav
migrations. When the Slavs south of the Letts moved west,
other Slav tribes must have pushed north, thus
driving both Letts and Finns west to the Baltic
provinces, which had previously been occupied
by the Germans (Goths). Some of the Western Finns must
have found their way about 500 <small>A.D.</small>, scarcely earlier, into parts
of this region, where they came into hostile and friendly contact
with the Norsemen. These relations would even appear
to be reflected in the Norse mythology, which may be regarded
as in great measure an echo of historic events. The wars of
the Swedish and Danish kings referred to in these oral records
may be interpreted as plundering expeditions rather than permanent
conquests, while the undoubtedly active intercourse
between the east and west coasts of the Baltic may be explained
on the assumption that, after the withdrawal of the Goths, a
remnant of the Germanic populations remained behind in the
Baltic provinces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Finno-Russ
Origins.</div>

<p>From Nestor's statement that all three of the Varangian
princes settled, not amongst Slavish but amongst Finnish
peoples, it may be inferred that the Finnish element
constituted the most important section in
the newly founded Russian State; and it may
here be mentioned that the term "Russ" itself has now been
traced to the Finnish word <i>Ruost</i> (<i>Ruosti</i>), a "Norseman." But
although at first greatly outnumbering the Slavs, the Finnish
peoples soon lost the political ascendancy, and their subsequent
history may be summed up in the expression&mdash;gradual absorption
in the surrounding Slav populations. This inevitable process
is still going on amongst all the Volga, Lake and Baltic
Finns, except in Finland and Lapland, where other conditions
obtain<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tavastian
and Karelian
Finns.</div>

<p>Most Finnish ethnologists agree that however much they
may now differ in their physical and mental characters and
usages, Finns and Lapps were all originally one people. Some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>variant of <i>Suoma</i><a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> enters into the national name of all the Baltic
groups&mdash;<i>Suomalaiset</i>, the Finns of Finland, <i>Somela&iuml;zed</i>, those
of Esthonia, <i>Samelats</i> (Sabmelad), the Lapps, <i>Samoyad</i>, the
Samoyeds. In Ohthere's time the Norsemen called all the
Lapps "Finnas" (as the Norwegians still do), and that early
navigator already noticed that these "Finns"
seemed to speak the same language as the
Beormas, who were true Finns<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>. Nor do the
present inhabitants of Finland, taken as a whole, differ more
in outward appearance and temperament from their Lapp
neighbours than do the Tavastians and the Karelians, that
is, their western and eastern sections, from each other. The
Tavastians, who call themselves H&eacute;melaiset, "Lake People,"
have rather broad, heavy frames, small and oblique blue or
grey eyes, towy hair and white complexion, without the clear
florid colour of the North Germanic and English peoples. The
temperament is somewhat sluggish, passive and enduring,
morose and vindictive, but honest and trustworthy.</p>

<p>Very different are the tall, slim, active Karelians (<i>Karialaiset</i>,
"Cowherds," from <i>Kari</i>, "Cow"), with more regular
features, straight grey eyes, brown complexion, and chestnut
hair, like that of the hero of the Kalevala, hanging in ringlets
down the shoulders. Many of the Karelians, and most of the
neighbouring <i>Ingrians</i> about the head of the Gulf of Finland,
as well as the Votes and Vepses of the great lakes, have been
assimilated in speech, religion, and usages to the surrounding
Russian populations. But the more conservative Tavastians
have hitherto tenaciously preserved the national sentiment,
language, and traditions. Despite the pressure of Sweden on
the west, and of Russia on the east, the Finns still stand out
as a distinct European nationality, and continue to cultivate
with success their harmonious and highly poetical language.
Since the twelfth century they have been Christians, converted
to the Catholic faith by "Saint" Eric, King of Sweden, and
later to Lutheranism, again by the Swedes<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>. The national
university, removed in 1827 from Abo to Helsingfors, is a
centre of much scientific and literary work, and here E. L&ouml;nnrot,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
father of Finnish literature, brought out his various editions of
the <i>Kalevala</i>, that of 1849 consisting of some 50,000 strophes<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Kw&aelig;ns.</div>

<p>A kind of transition from these settled and cultured Finns
to the Lapps of Scandinavia and Russia is formed by the still
almost nomad, or at least restless <i>Kw&aelig;ns</i>, who
formerly roamed as far as the White Sea, which
in Alfred's time was known as the <i>Cwen S&aelig;</i> (Kw&aelig;n Sea).
These Kw&aelig;ns, who still number nearly 300,000, are even called
nomads by J. A. Friis, who tells us that there is a continual
movement of small bands between Finland and Scandinavia.
"The wandering Kw&aelig;ns pass round the Gulf of Bothnia and
up through Lappmarken to Kittal&auml;, where they separate, some
going to Varanger, and others to Alten. They follow the
same route as that which, according to historians, some of the
Norsemen followed in their wanderings from Finland<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>." The
references of the Sagas are mostly to these primitive Bothnian
Finns, with whom the Norsemen first came in contact, and who
in the sixth and following centuries were still in a rude state
not greatly removed from that of their Ugrian forefathers. As
shown by Almqvist's researches, they lived almost exclusively
by hunting and fishing, had scarcely a rudimentary knowledge
of agriculture, and could prepare neither butter nor cheese from
the milk of their half-wild reindeer herds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lapps,
Samoyeds and
Permian Finns.</div>

<p>Such were also, and in some measure still are, the kindred
Lapps, who with the allied <i>Yurak Samoyeds</i> of Arctic Russia
are the only true nomads still surviving in Europe.
A. H. Cocks, who travelled amongst all these
rude aborigines in 1888, describes the Kw&aelig;ns
who range north to Lake Enara, as "for the most part of a
very rough class," and found that the Russian Lapps of the
Kola Peninsula, "except as to their clothing and the addition
of coffee and sugar to their food supply, are living now much
the same life as their ancestors probably lived 2000 or more
years ago, a far more primitive life, in fact, than the Reindeer
Lapps [of Scandinavia]. They have not yet begun to use
tobacco, and reading and writing are entirely unknown among
them. Unlike the three other divisions of the race [the Norwegian,
Swedish, and Finnish Lapps], they are a very cheerful,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
light-hearted people, and have the curious habit of expressing
their thoughts aloud in extempore sing-song<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>."</p>

<p>Similar traits have been noticed in the Samoyeds, whom
F. G. Jackson describes as an extremely sociable and hospitable
people, delighting in gossip, and much given to laughter and
merriment<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>. He gives their mean height as nearly 5 ft. 2 in.,
which is about the same as that of the Lapps (Von D&uuml;ben,
5 ft. 2 in., others rather less), while that of the Finns averages
5 ft. 5 in. (Topinard). Although the general Mongol appearance
is much less pronounced in the Lapps than in the Samoyeds,
in some respects&mdash;low stature, flat face with peculiar round
outline&mdash;the latter reminded Jackson of the Ziryanians, who are
a branch of the Beormas (Permian Finns), though like them
now much mixed with the Russians. The so-called prehistoric
"Lapp Graves," occurring throughout the southern parts of
Scandinavia, are now known from their contents to have belonged
to the Norse race, who appear to have occupied this
region since the New Stone Age, while the Lapp domain seems
never to have reached very much farther south than Trondhjem.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lapp Origins
and Migrations.</div>

<p>All these facts, taken especially in connection with the late
arrival of the Finns themselves in Finland, lend support to
the view that the Lapps are a branch, not of
the Suomalaiset, but of the Permian Finns, and
reached their present homes, not from Finland,
but from North Russia through the Kanin and Kola Peninsulas,
if not round the shores of the White Sea, at some remote period
prior to the occupation of Finland by its present inhabitants.
This assumption would also explain Ohthere's statement that
Lapps and Permians seemed to speak nearly the same language.
The resemblance is still close, though I am not competent to
say to which branch of the Finno-Ugrian family Lapp is most
nearly allied.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Temperament&mdash;Religion.</div>

<p>Of the Mongol physical characters the Lapp still retains
the round low skull (index 83), the prominent cheek-bones,
somewhat flat features, and ungainly figure. The
temperament, also, is still perhaps more Asiatic
than European, although since the eighteenth
century they have been Christians&mdash;Lutherans in Scandinavia,
Orthodox in Russia. In pagan times Shamanism had nowhere
acquired a greater development than among the Lapps. A great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
feature of the system were the "rune-trees," made of pine or
birch bark, inscribed with figures of gods, men, or animals,
which were consulted on all important occasions, and their
mysterious signs interpreted by the Shamans. Even foreign
potentates hearkened to the voice of these renowned magicians,
and in England the expression "Lapland witches" became
proverbial, although it appears that there never were any
witches, but only wizards, in Lapland. Such rites have long
ceased to be practised, although some of the crude ideas of a
material after-life still linger on. Money and other treasures
are often buried or hid away, the owners dying without revealing
the secret, either through forgetfulness, or more probably of
set purpose in the hope of thus making provision for the other
world.</p>

<p>Amongst the kindred Samoyeds, despite their Russian orthodoxy,
the old pagan beliefs enjoy a still more vigorous existence.
"As long as things go well with him, he is a Christian;
but should his reindeer die, or other catastrophe happen, he
immediately returns to his old god <i>Num</i> or <i>Chaddi</i>.... He conducts
his heathen services by night and in secret, and carefully
screens from sight any image of Chaddi<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>." Jackson noticed
several instances of this compromise between the old and the
new, such as the wooden cross supplemented on the Samoyed
graves by an overturned sledge to convey the dead safely over
the snows of the under-world, and the rings of stones, within
which the human sacrifices were perhaps formerly offered to
propitiate Chaddi; and although these things have ceased, "it
is only a few years ago that a Samoyad living on Novaia Zemlia
sacrificed a young girl<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Volga
Finns.</div>

<p>Similar beliefs and practices still prevail not only amongst
the Siberian Finns&mdash;Ostyaks of the Yenisei and Obi rivers,
Voguls of the Urals&mdash;but even amongst the Votyaks,
Mordvinians, Cheremisses and other scattered
groups still surviving in the Volga basin.
So recently as the year 1896 a number of Votyaks were tried
and convicted for the murder of a passing mendicant, whom
they had beheaded to appease the wrath of Kiremet, Spirit of
Evil and author of the famine raging at that time in Central
Russia. Besides Kiremet, the Votyaks&mdash;who appear to have
migrated from the Urals to their present homes between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>

heathens&mdash;also worship Inmar, God of Heaven, to whom they
sacrifice animals as well as human beings whenever it can be
safely done. We are assured by Baron de Baye that even the
few who are baptized take part secretly in these unhallowed
rites<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>.</p>

<p>To the Ugrian branch, rudest and most savage of all the
Finnish peoples, belong these now moribund Volga groups, as
well as the fierce Bulgar and Magyar hordes, if not also their
precursors, the <i>Jazyges</i> and <i>Rhoxolani</i>, who in the second century
A.D. swarmed into Pannonia from the Russian steppe, and
in company with the Germanic Quadi and Marcomanni twice
(168 and 172) advanced to the walls of Aquileia, and were
twice arrested by the legions of Marcus Aurelius and Verus.
Of the once numerous Jazyges, whom Pliny calls Sarmates,
there were several branches&mdash;<i>Maeotae</i>, Metanastae, <i>Basilii</i>
("Royal")&mdash;who were first reduced by the Goths spreading
from the Baltic to the Euxine and Lower Danube, and then
overwhelmed with the Dacians, Getae, Bastarnae, and a hundred
other ancient peoples in the great deluge of the Hunnish
invasion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bulgars&mdash;Origins
and
Migrations.</div>

<p>From the same South Russian steppe&mdash;the plains watered
by the Lower Don and Dnieper&mdash;came the <i>Bulgars</i>, first in
association with the Huns, from whom they are
scarcely distinguished by the early Byzantine
writers, and then as a separate people, who, after
throwing off the yoke of the Avars (635 <small>A.D.</small>), withdrew before
the pressure of the Khazars westwards to the Lower Danube
(678). But their records go much farther back than these dates,
and while philologists and archaeologists are able to trace their
wanderings step by step north to the Middle Volga and the
Ural Mountains, authentic Armenian documents carry their
history back to the second century <small>B.C.</small> Under the Arsacides
numerous bands of Bulgars, driven from their homes about
the Kama confluence by civil strife, settled on the banks of
the Aras, and since that time (150-114 <small>B.C.</small>) the Bulgars were
known to the Armenians as a great nation dwelling away to
the north far beyond the Caucasus.</p>


<p>Originally the name, which afterwards acquired such an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
odious notoriety amongst the European peoples, may have
been more geographical than ethnical, implying not so much
a particular nation as all the inhabitants of the <i>Bulga</i> (Volga)
between the Kama and the Caspian. But at that time this
section of the great river seems to have been mainly held by
more or less homogeneous branches of the Finno-Ugrian family,
and palethnologists have now shown that to this connection
beyond all question belonged in physical appearance, speech,
and usages those bands known as Bulgars, who formed permanent
settlements in Moesia south of the Lower Danube towards
the close of the seventh century<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>. Here "these bold and
dexterous archers, who drank the milk and feasted on the flesh
of their fleet and indefatigable horses; whose flocks and herds
followed, or rather guided, the motions of their roving camps;
to whose inroads no country was remote or impervious, and
who were practised in flight, though incapable of fear<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>," established
a powerful state, which maintained its independence for
over seven hundred years (678-1392).</p>

<p>Acting at first in association with the Slavs, and then
assuming "a vague dominion" over their restless Sarmatian
allies, the Bulgars spread the terror of their hated name throughout
the Balkan lands, and were prevented only by the skill of
Belisarius from anticipating their Turki kinsmen in the overthrow
of the Byzantine Empire itself. Procopius and Jornandes
have left terrible pictures of the ferocity, debasement, and utter
savagery, both of the Bulgars and of their Slav confederates
during the period preceding the foundation of the Bulgar
dynasty in Moesia. Wherever the Slavs (Antes, Slavini)
passed, no soul was left alive; Thrace and Illyria were strewn
with unburied corpses; captives were shut up with horse and
cattle in stables, and all consumed together, while the brutal
hordes danced to the music of their shrieks and groans. Indescribable
was the horror inspired by the Bulgars, who killed
for killing's sake, wasted for sheer love of destruction, swept
away all works of the human hand, burnt, razed cities, left in
their wake nought but a picture of their own cheerless native
steppes. Of all the barbarians that harried the Empire, the
Bulgars have left the most detested name, although closely
rivalled by the Slavs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p>To the ethnologist the later history of the Bulgarians is
of exceptional interest. They entered the Danubian lands in
the seventh century as typical Ugro-Finns, repulsive alike in
physical appearance and mental characters. Their dreaded
chief, Krum, celebrated his triumphs with sanguinary rites,
and his followers yielded in no respects to the Huns themselves
in coarseness and brutality. Yet an almost complete moral if
not physical transformation had been effected by the middle
of the ninth century, when the Bulgars were evangelised by
Byzantine missionaries, exchanged their rude Ugrian speech
for a Slavonic tongue, the so-called "Church Slav," or even
"Old Bulgarian," and became henceforth merged in the surrounding
Slav populations. The national name "Bulgar"
alone survives, as that of a somewhat peaceful southern "Slav"
people, who in our time again acquired the political independence
of which they had been deprived by Bajazet I. in
1392.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Great and Little
Bulgaria.</div>

<p>Nor did this name disappear from the Volga lands after the
great migration of Bulgar hordes to the Don basin during the
third and fourth centuries <small>A.D.</small> On the contrary,
here arose another and a greater Bulgar empire,
which was known to the Byzantines of the tenth
century as "Black Bulgaria," and later to the Arabs and
Western peoples as "Great Bulgaria," in contradistinction to
the "Little Bulgaria" south of the Danube<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>. It fell to pieces
during the later "Tatar" wars, and nothing now remains of
the Volga Bulgars, except the Volga itself from which they
were named.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Avars and
Magyars.</div>

<p>In the same region, but farther north<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>, lay also a "Great
Hungary," the original seat of those other Ugrian Finns known
as Hungarians and Magyars, who followed later
in the track of the Bulgars, and like them formed
permanent settlements in the Danube basin, but
higher up in Pannonia, the present kingdom of Hungary.
Here, however, the Magyars had been preceded by the kindred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
(or at least distantly connected) Avars, the dominant people
in the Middle Danube lands for a great part of the period
between the departure of the Huns and the arrival of the
Magyars<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a>. Rolling up like a storm cloud from the depths of
Siberia to the Volga and Euxine, sweeping everything before
them, reducing Kutigurs, Utigurs, Bulgars, and Slavs, the
Avars presented themselves in the sixth century on the frontiers
of the empire as the unwelcome allies of Justinian. Arrested
at the Elbe by the Austrasian Franks, and hard pressed by
the Gepidae, they withdrew to the Lower Danube under the
ferocious Khagan Bayan, who, before his overthrow by the
Emperor Mauritius and death in 602, had crossed the Danube,
captured Sirmium, and reduced the whole region bordering on
the Byzantine empire. Later the still powerful Avars with
their Slav followers, "the Avar viper and the Slav locust,"
overran the Balkan lands, and in 625 nearly captured Constantinople.
They were at last crushed by Pepin, king of Italy,
who reoccupied Sirmium in 799, and brought back such treasure
that the value of gold was for a time enormously reduced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magyar
Origins and
early Records.</div>

<p>Then came the opportunity of the <i>Hunagars</i> (Hungarians),
who, after advancing from the Urals to the Volga (550 <small>A.D.</small>),
had reached the Danube about 886. Here they were invited
to the aid of the Germanic king Arnulf, threatened by a formidable
coalition of the western Slavs under the
redoubtable Zventibolg, a nominal Christian who
would enter the church on horseback followed by
his wild retainers, and threaten the priest at the altar with the
lash. In the upland Transylvanian valleys the Hunagars had
been joined by eight of the derelict Khazar tribes, amongst
whom were the <i>Megers</i> or <i>Mogers</i>, whose name under the form
of <i>Magyar</i> was eventually extended to the united Hunagar-Khazar
nation. Under their renowned king Arpad, son of
Almuth, they first overthrew Zventibolg, and then with the
help of the surviving Avars reduced the surrounding Slav
populations. Thus towards the close of the ninth century was
founded in Pannonia the present kingdom of Hungary, in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
were absorbed all the kindred Mongol and Finno-Turki elements
that still survived from the two previous Mongolo-Turki
empires, established in the same region by the Huns under
Attila (430-453), and by the Avars under Khagan Bayan
(562-602).</p>

<p>After reducing the whole of Pannonia and ravaging Carinthia
and Friuli, the Hunagars raided Bavaria and Italy (899-900),
imposed a tribute on the feeble successor of Arnulf (910),
and pushed their plundering expeditions as far west as Alsace,
Lorraine, and Burgundy, everywhere committing atrocities
that recalled the memory of Attila's savage hordes. Trained
riders, archers and javelin-throwers from infancy, they advanced
to the attack in numerous companies following hard upon each
other, avoiding close quarters, but wearing out their antagonists
by the persistence of their onslaughts. They were the scourge
and terror of Europe, and were publicly proclaimed by the
Emperor Otto I. (955) the enemies of God and humanity.</p>

<p>This period of lawlessness and savagery was closed by the
conversion of Saint Stephen I. (997-1038), after which the
Magyars became gradually assimilated in type and general
culture, but not in speech, to the western nations<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a>. Their harmonious
and highly cultivated language still remains a typical
member of the Ural-Altaic family, reflecting in its somewhat
composite vocabulary the various Finno-Ugric and Turki elements
(Ugrians and Permians from the Urals, Volga Finns,
Turki Avars and Khazars), of which the substratum of the
Magyar nation is constituted<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>.</p>

<p>"The modern Magyars," says Peisker, "are one of the
most varied race-mixtures on the face of the earth, and one of
the two chief Magyar types of today&mdash;traced to the Arpad era
[end of ninth century] by tomb-findings&mdash;is dolichocephalic
with a narrow visage. There we have before us Altaian origin,
Ugrian speech and Indo-European type combined<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>."</p>

<p>Politically the Magyars continue to occupy a position of
vital importance in Eastern Europe, wedged in between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
northern and southern Slav peoples, and thus presenting an
insurmountable obstacle to the aspirations of the Panslavist
dreamers. The fiery and vigorous Magyar nationality, a compact
body of about 8,000,000 (1898), holds the boundless plains
watered by the Middle Danube and the Theiss, and thus permanently
separates the Chechs, Moravians, and Slovaks of
Bohemia and the northern Carpathians from their kinsmen,
the Yugo-Slavs ("Southern Slavs") of Servia and the other
now Slavonised Balkan lands. These Yugo-Slavs are in their
turn severed by the Rumanians of Neo-Latin speech from their
northern and eastern brethren, the Ruthenians, Poles, Great
and Little Russians. Had the Magyars and Rumanians adopted
any of the neighbouring Slav idioms, it is safe to say that, like
the Ugrian Bulgarians, they must have long ago been absorbed
in the surrounding Panslav world, with consequences to the
central European nations which it would not be difficult to forecast.
Here we have a striking illustration of the influence of
language in developing and preserving the national sentiment,
analogous in many respects to that now witnessed on a larger
scale amongst the English-speaking populations on both sides
of the Atlantic and in the Austral lands. From this point of
view the ethnologist may unreservedly accept Ehrenreich's
trenchant remark that "the nation stands and falls with its
speech<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a>."</p>

tells as that it is hard to say whether they are Moslem, Pagan (Shamanists), or
Manichean, this last because they believe God has made good angels called
<i>Mankir</i> and bad angels called <i>Nankir</i>. Two of these spirits sit invisibly on the
shoulders of every person from his birth, the good on the right, the bad on the
left, each noting his actions in their respective books, and balancing accounts at
his death. It is interesting to compare these ideas with those of the Uzbeg prince
who explained to Lansdell that at the resurrection, the earth being flat, the dead
grow out of it like grass; then God divides the good from the bad, sending these
below and those above. In heaven nobody dies, and every wish is gratified; even
the wicked creditor may seek out his debtor, and in lieu of the money owing may
take over the equivalent in his good deeds, if there be any, and thus be saved

April, 1898, p. 238 sq.) shows from the primitive character of the mythology, the
frequent allusions to copper or bronze, and the almost utter absence of Christian
ideas and other indications, that these songs must be of great antiquity. "There
seems to be no doubt that some parts date back to at least 3000 years ago, before
the Finns and the Hungarians had become distinct peoples; for the names of the
divinities, many of the customs, and even particular incantations and bits of superstitions
mentioned in the Kalevala are curiously duplicated in ancient Hungarian
writings."</p></div>

Norsemen, and the <i>Permiaki</i> (<i>Permians</i>) of the Russians (<i>Orosius</i>, <small>I.</small> 13). In
medieval times the whole region between the White Sea and the Urals was often
called Permia; but since the withdrawal southwards of the Zirynians and other
Permian Finns this Arctic region has been thinly occupied by Samoyed tribes
spreading slowly westward from Siberia to the Pechora and Lower Dvina.</p></div>

<p><b>Hair</b>, <i>black, lank, coarse, often very long, nearly round in
transverse section; very scanty on face and practically absent
on body</i>; <b>Colour</b>, <i>differs, according to localities,

but the prevailing colour is brown</i>; <b>Skull</b>,
<i>generally mesaticephalous (79), but with wide range from 65
(some Eskimo) to 89 or 90 (some British Columbians, Peruvians);
the</i> <b>os Incae</b> <i>more frequently present than amongst
other races, but the</i> <b>os linguae</b> <i>(hyoid bone) often imperfectly

<i>as a rule rather prominent laterally, and also high</i>;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
<b>Nose</b>, <i>generally large, straight or even aquiline, and mesorrhine</i>;
<b>Eyes</b>, <i>nearly always dark brown, with a yellowish
conjunctiva, and the eye-slits show a prevailing tendency to a
slight upward slant</i>; <b>Stature</b>, <i>usually above the medium 1.728 m.
(5 ft. 8 or 10 in.), but variable&mdash;under 1.677 m. (5 ft. 6 in.) on
the western plateaux (Peruvians, etc.), also in Fuegia and

Central Brazil (Bororos) and Prairie (Algonquians, Iroquoians);
the relative proportions of the two elements of the arms and of
the legs (radio-humeral and tibio-femoral indices) are intermediate
between those of whites and negroes</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mental
Characters.</div>

<p><b>Temperament</b>, <i>moody, reserved, and wary; outwardly
impassive and capable of enduring extreme physical pain; considerate
towards each other, kind and gentle towards
their women and children, but not in a
demonstrative manner; keen sense of justice, hence
easily offended, but also easily pacified. The outward show of
dignity and a lofty air assumed by many seems due more to
vanity or ostentation than to a feeling of true pride. Mental
capacity considerable, much higher than the Negro, but on the
whole inferior to the Mongol</i>.</p>

<p><b>Speech</b>, <i>exclusively polysynthetic, a type unknown elsewhere;
is not a primitive condition, but a highly specialised
form of agglutination, in which all the terms of the sentence
tend to coalesce in a single polysyllabic word; stock languages
very numerous, perhaps more so than all the stock languages
of all the other orders of speech in the rest of the world</i>.</p>

<p><b>Religion</b>, <i>various grades of spirit and nature worship,
corresponding to the various cultural grades; a crude form of
shamanism prevalent amongst most of the North American
aborigines, polytheism with sacrifice and priestcraft amongst
the cultured peoples (Aztecs, Mayas, etc.); the monotheistic
concept nowhere clearly evolved; belief in a natural after-life
very prevalent, if not universal</i>.</p>

<p><b>Culture</b>, <i>highly diversified, ranging from the lowest stages
of savagery through various degrees of barbarism to the advanced
social state of the more or less civilised Mayas, Aztecs, Chibchas,
Yungas, Quichuas, and Aymaras; amongst these pottery, weaving,
metal-work, agriculture, and especially architecture fairly well
developed; letters less so, although the Maya script seems to
have reached the true phonetic state; navigation and science
rudimentary or absent; savagery generally far more prevalent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">American
Origins.</div>

<p>It is impossible to dissociate the ethnological history of the
New World from that of the Old. The absence from America
at any period of the world's history not only of anthropoid apes
but also of the <i>Cercopithecidae</i>, in other words
of the Catarrhini, entirely precludes the possibility
of the independent origin of man in the western
hemisphere. Therefore the population of the Americas must
have come from the Old World. In prehistoric times there were
only two possible routes for such immigration to have taken
place. For the mid-Atlantic land connection was severed long
ages before the appearance of man, and the connection of South
America with Antarctica had also long disappeared<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>. We are
therefore compelled to look to a farther extension of land between
North America and northern Europe on the one hand,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
and between north-west America and north-east Asia on the
other. We know that in late Tertiary times there was a land-bridge
connecting north-west Europe with Greenland, and
Scharff<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> believes that the Barren-ground reindeer took this
route to Norway and western Europe during early glacial times,
but that "towards the latter part of the Glacial period the land-connection
... broke down." Other authorities are of opinion
that the continuous land between the two continents in higher
latitudes remained until post-glacial times. Brinton<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> considered
that it was impossible for man to have reached America from
Asia, because Siberia was covered with glaciers and not peopled
until late Neolithic times, whereas man was living in both
North and South America at the close of the Glacial Age.
He acknowledged frequent communication in later times between
Asia and America, but maintained that the movement
was rather from America to Asia than otherwise. He was
therefore a strong advocate of the European origin of the
American race. There is no doubt that North America was
connected with Asia in Tertiary times, though some geologists
assert that "the far North-west did not rise from the waves
of the Pacific Ocean (which once flowed with a boundless expanse
to the North Pole) until after the glacial period." In
that case "the first inhabitants of America certainly did not
get there in this way, for by that time the bones of many
generations were already bleaching on the soil of the New
World<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a>." The "Miocene Bridge," as the land connecting
Asia and America in late geological times has been called, was
probably very wide, one side would stretch from Kamchatka
to British Columbia, and the other across Behring Strait. If,
as seems probable, this connection persisted till, or was reconstituted
during, the human period, tribes migrating to America
by the more northerly route would enter the land east of the
great barrier of the Rocky Mountains. The route from the
Old World to the New by the Pacific margin probably remained
nearly always open. Thus, while not denying the possibility
of a very early migration from North Europe to North America
through Greenland, it appears more probable that America
received its population from North Asia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fossil Man in
America.</div>

<p>We have next to determine what were the characteristics
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>of the earliest inhabitants of America, and the approximate
date of their arrival. There have been many sensational
accounts of the discoveries of fossil man
in America, which have not been able to stand
the criticism of scientific investigation. It must always be
remembered that the evidence is primarily one of stratigraphy.
Assuming, of course, that the human skeletal remains found in
a given deposit are contemporaneous with the formation of
that deposit and not subsequently interred in it, it is for the
geologist to determine the age. The amount of petrifaction
and the state of preservation of the bones are quite fallacious
nor can much reliance be placed upon the anatomical character
of the remains. Primordial human remains may be expected
to show ancestral characters to a marked degree, but as we
have insufficient data to enable us to determine the rate of
evolution, anatomical considerations must fit into the timescale
granted by the geologist.</p>

<p>Apart from pure stratigraphy associated animal remains
may serve to support or refute the claims to antiquity, while
the presence of artifacts, objects made or used by man, may
afford evidence for determining the relative date if the cultural
stratigraphy of the area has been sufficiently established.</p>

<p>Fortunately the fossil human remains of America have been
carefully studied by a competent authority who says, "Irrespective
of other considerations, in every instance where enough
of the bones is preserved for comparison the somatological
evidence bears witness against the geological antiquity of the
remains and for their close affinity to, or identity with those of
the modern Indian. Under these circumstances but one conclusion
is justified, which is that thus far on this continent, no
human bones of undisputed geological antiquity are known<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>."
Hrdli&#269;ka subsequently studied the remains of South America
and says, "A conscientious, unbiased study of all the available
facts has shown that the whole structure erected in support of
the theory of geologically ancient man on that continent rests
on very imperfectly and incorrectly interpreted data and in
many instances on false premises, and as a consequence of
these weaknesses must completely collapse when subjected to
searching criticism.&mdash;As to the antiquity of the various archaeological
remains from Argentina attributed to early man, all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
those to which particular importance has been attached have
been found without tenable claim to great age, while others,
mostly single objects, without exception fall into the category
of the doubtful<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>."</p>

<p>The conclusions of W. H. Holmes, Bailey Willis, F. E.
Wright and C. N. Fenner, who collaborated with Hrdli&#269;ka,
with regard to the evidence thus far furnished, are that, "it
fails to establish the claim that in South America there have
been brought forth thus far tangible traces of either geologically
ancient man himself or of any precursors of the human race<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>."
Hrdli&#269;ka is careful to add, however, "This should not be
taken as a categorical denial of the existence of early man in
South America, however improbable such a presence may now
appear."</p>

<p>According to J. W. Gidley<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> the evidence of vertebrate
paleontology indicates (1) That man did not exist in North
America at the beginning of the Pleistocene although there
was a land connection between Asia and North America
at that time permitting a free passage for large mammals.
(2) That a similar land connection was again in existence at
the close of the last glacial epoch, and probably continued up
to comparatively recent times, as indicated by the close resemblance
of related living mammalian species on either side
of the present Behring Strait. (3) That the first authentic
records of prehistoric man in America have been found in
deposits that are not older than the last glacial epoch, and
probably of even later date, the inference being that man first
found his way into North America at some time near the close
of the existence of this last land bridge. (4) That this land
bridge was broad and vegetative, and the climate presumably
mild, at least along its southern coast border, making it habitable
for man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lagoa-Santa
Race.</div>

<p>Rivet<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> points out that from Brazil to Terra del Fuegia on
the Atlantic slope, in Bolivia and Peru, on the high plateaux
of the Andes, on the Pacific coast and perhaps
in the south of California, traces of a distinct race
are met with, sometimes in single individuals,
sometimes in whole groups. This race of Lagoa Santa is an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
important primordial element in the population of South
America, and has been termed by Deniker the Palaeo-American
sub-race<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a>.</p>

<p>The men were of low stature but considerable strength, the
skull was long, narrow and high, of moderate size, prognathous,
with strong brow ridges, but not a retreating forehead. There
is no reliable evidence as to the age of these remains. Hrdli&#269;ka,
after reviewing all the evidence says, "Besides agreeing closely
with the dolichocephalic American type, which had an extensive
representation throughout Brazil, including the Province of
Minas Geraes, and in many other parts of South America, it is
the same type which is met with farther north among the Aztec,
Tarasco, Otomi, Tarahumare, Pima, Californians, ancient Utah
cliff dwellers, ancient north-eastern Pueblos, Shoshoni, many
of the Plains Tribes, Iroquois, Eastern Siouan, and Algonquian.
But it is apart from the Eskimo, who form a distinct subtype
of the yellow-brown strain of humanity<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>."</p>

<p>Rivet<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> adds that an examination of the present distribution
of the descendants of the Lagoa-Santa type shows that they are
all border peoples, in East Brazil, and the south of Patagonia
and Terra del Fuegia, where the climate is rigorous, in desert
islands of west and southern Chili, on the coast of Ecuador, and
perhaps in California. This suggests that they have been
driven out in a great eccentric movement from their old habitat,
into new environment producing fresh crossings.</p>

<p>There is an absence of this high narrow-headed type
throughout the northern part of South America, and a prevalence
of medium or sub-brachycephalic heads which are
always low in the crown. These are now represented by the
Caribs and Arawaks, but there was more than one migration
of brachycephalic peoples from the north.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physical Type
in North
America.</div>

<p>To return to North America. As we have just seen
Hrdli&#269;ka recognises a dolichocephalic element in North
America, and various ethnic groups range to pronounced
brachycephaly. Nevertheless he believes
in the original unity of the Indian race in America,
basing his conclusions on the colour of the skin, which ranges
from yellowish white to dark brown, the straight black hair,
scanty beard, hairless body, brown and often more or less slanting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
eye, mesorrhine nose, medium prognathism, skeletal proportions
and other essential features. In all these characters the
American Indians resemble the yellowish brown peoples of
eastern Asia and a large part of Polynesia<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>. He also believes
that there were many successive migrations from Asia.</p>

<p>The differences of opinion between Hrdli&#269;ka and other
students is probably more a question of nomenclature than of
fact. The eastern Asiatics and Polynesians are mixed peoples,
and if there were numerous migrations from Asia, spread over
a very long period of time, people of different stocks would
have found their way into America. "It is indeed probable,"
Hrdli&#269;ka adds, "that the western coast of America, within the
last two thousand years, was on more than one occasion reached
by small parties of Polynesians, and that the eastern coast was
similarly reached by small groups of whites; but these accretions
have not modified greatly, if at all, the mass of the native
population<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a>."</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the plains east of the Rocky Mountains
and the eastern wooded area are characterised by a head which
varies about the lower limit of brachycephaly, and by tall
stature. This stock probably arrived by the North Pacific
Bridge before the end of the last Glacial period, and extended
over the continent east of the great divide. Finally bands from
the north, east and south migrated into the prairie area. The
markedly brachycephalic immigrants from Asia appear to have
proceeded mainly down the Pacific slope and to have populated
Central and South America, with an overflow into the south
of North America. It is probable that there were several
migrations of allied but not similar broad-headed peoples from
Asia in early days, and we know that recently there have been
racial and cultural drifts between the neighbouring portions of
America and Asia<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a>. Indeed Bogoras<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> suggests that ethnographically
the line separating Asia and America should lie
from the lower Kolyma River to Gishiga Bay.</p>

<p>Owing to these various immigrations and subsequent
minglings the cranial forms show much variation, and are not
sufficiently significant to serve as a basis of classification. In
parts of North America the round-headed mound-builders and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
others were encroached upon by populations of increasingly
dolichocephalic type&mdash;Plains Indians and Cherokees, Chichimecs,
Tepanecs, Acolhuas. Even still dolichocephaly is characteristic
of Iroquois, Coahuilas, Sonorans, while the intermediate
indices met with on the prairies and plateaux undoubtedly
indicate the mixture between the long-headed invaders and the
round-heads whom they swept aside as they advanced southwards.
Thus the Minnetaris are highly dolicho; the Poncas
and Osages sub-brachy; the Algonquians variable, while the
Siouans oscillate widely round a mesaticephalous mean.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cranial
Deformation.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The "Toltecs."</div>

<p>The Athapascans alone are homogeneous, and their sub-brachycephaly
recurs amongst the Apaches and their other
southern kindred, who have given it an exaggerated
form by the widespread practice of artificial
deformation, which dates from remote times.
The most typical cases both of brachy and dolicho deformation
are from the Cerro de las Palmas graves in south-west Mexico.
Deformation prevails also in Peru and Bolivia, as well as in
Ceara and the Rio Negro on the Atlantic side. The flat-head
form, so common from the Columbia estuary to Peru, occurs
amongst the broad-faced Huaxtecs, their near relations the
Maya-Quich&eacute;s, and the Nahuatlans. It is also found amongst
the extinct Cebunys of Cuba, Hayti and Jamaica,
and the so-called "Toltecs," that is, the people
of Tollan (Tula), who first founded a civilised state on the
Mexican table-land (sixth and seventh centuries <small>A.D.</small>), and whose
name afterwards became associated with every ancient monument
throughout Central America. On this "Toltec question"
the most contradictory theories are current; some hold that
the Toltecs were a great and powerful nation, who after the
overthrow of their empire migrated southwards, spreading their
culture throughout Central America; others regard them as
"fabulous," or at all events "nothing more than a sept of the
Nahuas themselves, the ancestors of those Mexicans who built
Tenochtitlan," <i>i.e.</i> the present city of Mexico. A third view,
that of Valentini, that the Toltecs were not Nahuas but Mayas,
is now supported both by E. P. Dieseldorff<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> and by F&ouml;rstemann<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a>.
T. A. Joyce<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> suggests that the vanguard of the Nahuas on
reaching the Mexican valley adopted and improved the culture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
of an agricultural people of Tarascan affinities whose culture
was in part due to Mayan inspiration, whom they found settled
there. Later migrations of Nahua were greatly impressed with
the "Toltec" culture which had thus arisen through the impact
of a virile hunting people on more passive agriculturalists.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Type of
North-west
Coast Indians
Variable.</div>

<p>On the North-west Pacific Coast similar ethnical interminglings
recur, and Franz Boas<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> here distinguishes as many as
four types, the Northern (Tsimshian and others),
the Kwakiutl, the Lillooet of the Harrison Lake
region and the inland Salishan (Flat-heads,
Shuswaps, etc.). All are brachycephalic, but while
the Tsimshians are of medium height 1.675 m. (5 ft. 6 in.) with
low, concave nose, very large head, and enormously broad face,
exceeding the average for North America by 6 mm., the
Kwakiutls are shorter 1.645 m. (5 ft. 4&frac34; in.) with very high and
relatively narrow hooked nose, and quite exceptionally high
face; the Harrison Lake very short 1.600 m. (5 ft 3 in.) with
exceedingly short and broad head (C. I. nearly 89), "surpassing
in this respect all other forms known to exist in North America";
lastly, the inland Salish of medium height 1.679 m. (5 ft. 6 in.)
with high and wide nose of the characteristic Indian form and
a short head.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Date of Migrations.</div>

<p>It would be difficult to find anywhere a greater contrast
than that which is presented by some of these British Columbian
natives, those, for instance, of Harrison Lake with almost circular
heads (88.8), and some of the Labrador Eskimo with a
degree of dolichocephaly not exceeded even by the Fijian Kai-Colos
(65)<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>. But this violent contrast is somewhat toned by
the intermediate forms, such as those of the Tlingits, the
Aleutian islanders, and the western (Alaskan) Eskimo, by which
the transition is effected between the Arctic and the more
southern populations. It is not possible at present to indicate
even in outline the chronology of any of the ethnic
movements outlined above. Warren K. Moorehead<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a>
agrees with the great majority of American
archaeologists in holding the existence of palaeolithic man in
North America as not proven<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a>, the so-called palaeoliths being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
either rejects or rude tools for rough purposes. When man
migrated to America from North and East Asia whenever that
period may have been, he appears to have been in that stage
of culture&mdash;or rather of stone technique&mdash;which we term Neolithic,
and the drifting movement ceased before he had learnt
the use of metals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidence from
Linguistics.</div>

<p>A further proof of the antiquity of the migrations is afforded
by linguistics. A. F. Chamberlain asserts<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> that "it may be said
with certainty, so far as all data hitherto presented
are concerned, that no satisfactory proof whatever
has been put forward to induce us to believe that
any single American Indian tongue or group of tongues has
been derived from any Old World form of speech now existing
or known to have existed in the past. In whatever way the
multiplicity of American Indian languages and dialects may
have arisen, one can be reasonably sure that the differentiation
and divergence have developed here in America and are in
no sense due to the occasional intrusion of Old World tongues
individually or <i>en masse</i>.... Certain real relationships between
the American Indians and the peoples of north-eastern Asia,
known as 'Paleo-Asiatics,' have, however, been revealed as a
result of the extensive investigations of the Jesup North Pacific
Expedition.... The general conclusion to be drawn from the
evidence is that the so-called 'Paleo-Asiatic' peoples of north-eastern
Asia, <i>i.e.</i> the Chukchee, Koryak, Kamchadale, Gilyak,
Yukaghir, etc. really belong physically and culturally with the
aborigines of north-western America.... Like the modern Asiatic
Eskimo they represent a reflex from America and Asia, and
not <i>vice versa</i>.... It is the opinion of good authorities also that the
'Paleo-Asiatic' peoples belong linguistically with the American
Indians rather than with the other tribes and stocks of northern
or southern Asia. Here we have then the only real relationship
of a linguistic character that has ever been convincingly argued
between tongues of the New World and tongues of the Old."</p>

<p>It is not merely that the American languages differ from
other forms of speech in their general phonetic, structural and
lexical features; they differ from them in their very morphology,
as much, for instance, as in the zoological world class differs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
from class, order from order. They have all of them developed
on the same polysynthetic lines, from which if a few here and
there now appear to depart, it is only because in the course of
their further evolution they have, so to say, broken away from
that prototype<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>. Take the rudest or the most highly cultivated
anywhere from Alaska to Fuegia&mdash;Eskimauan, Iroquoian,
Algonquian, Aztec, Tarascan, Ipurina, Peruvian, Yahgan&mdash;and
you will find each and all giving abundant evidence of this
universal polysynthetic character, not one true instance of which
can be found anywhere in the eastern hemisphere. There is
incorporation with the verb, as in Basque, many of the Caucasus
tongues, and the Ural-Altaic group; but it is everywhere limited
to pronominal and purely relational elements.</p>

<p>But in the American order of speech there is no such limitation,
and not merely the pronouns, which are restricted in
number, but the nouns with their attributes, which are practically
numberless, all enter necessarily into the verbal paradigm.
Thus in Tarascan (Mexico): <i>hopocuni</i> = to wash the hands;
<i>hopodini</i> = to wash the ears, from <i>hoponi</i> = to wash, which cannot
be used alone<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a>. So in Ipurina (Amazonia): <i>nicu&ccedil;acat&ccedil;aurumatini&iacute;</i>
= I draw the cord tight round your waist, from <i>ni</i>, I;
<i>cu&ccedil;aca</i>, to draw tight; <i>t&ccedil;a</i>, cord; <i>t&uacute;ruma</i>, waist; <i>tini</i>, characteristic
verbal affix; <i>&iacute;</i>, thy, referring to waist<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>.</p>

<p>We see from such examples that polysynthesis is not a
primitive condition of speech, as is often asserted, but on the
contrary a highly developed system, in which the original agglutinative
process has gone so far as to attract all the elements
of the sentence to the verb, round which they cluster like
swarming bees round their queen. In Eskimauan the tendency
is shown in the construction of nouns and verbs, by which
other classes of words are made almost unnecessary, and one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
word, sometimes of interminable length, is able to express
a whole sentence with its subordinate clauses. H. Rink, one
of the first Eskimo scholars of modern times, gives the instance:
"Su&eacute;r&uacute;kame-autdl&aacute;sassoq-tusaramiuk-tuningingmago-iluar&iacute;n-gil&aacute;t
= they did not approve that he (<i>a</i>) had omitted to give
him (<i>b</i>) something, as he (<i>a</i>) heard that he (<i>b</i>) was going to
depart on account of being destitute of everything<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>." Such
monstrosities "are so complicated that in daily speech they
could hardly ever occur; but still they are correct and can be
understood by intelligent people<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>."</p>

<p>He gives another and much longer example, which the
reader may be spared, adding that there are altogether about
200 particles, as many as ten of which may be piled up on any
given stem. The process also often involves great phonetic
changes, by which the original form of the elements becomes
disguised, as, for instance, in the English <i>hap'oth</i> = half-penny-worth.
The attempt to determine the number of words that
might be formed in this way on a single stem, such as <i>igdlo</i>, a
house, had to be given up after getting as far as the compound
<i>igdlorssualiortugssarsiumavoq</i> = he wants to find one who will
build a large house.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stock Languages.</div>

<p>It is clear that such a linguistic evolution implies both the
postulated isolation from other influences, which must have
disturbed and broken up the cumbrous process, and also the
postulated long period of time to develop and consolidate the
system throughout the New World. But time is still more
imperiously demanded by the vast number of
stock languages, many already extinct, many still
current all over the continent, all of which differ
profoundly in their vocabulary, often also in their phonesis,
and in fact have nothing in common except this extraordinary
polysynthetic groove in which they are cast. There are probably
about 75 stock languages in North America, of which 58 occur
north of Mexico.</p>

<p>But even that conveys but a faint idea of the astonishing
diversity of speech prevailing in this truly linguistic Babel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
J. W. Powell<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> points out that the practically distinct idioms are
far more numerous than might be inferred even from such a
large number of mother tongues. Thus, in the Algonquian<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a>
linguistic family he tells us there are about 40, no one of
which could be understood by a people speaking another; in
Athapascan from 30 to 40; in Siouan over 20; and in Shoshonian
a still greater number<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a>. The greatest linguistic diversity
in a relatively small area is found in the state of California,
where, according to Powell's classification, 22 distinct stocks
of languages are spoken. R. B. Dixon and A. L. Kroeber<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a>
show however that these fall into three morphological groups
which are also characterised by certain cultural features. It is
the same, or perhaps even worse, in Central and in South
America, where the linguistic confusion is so great that no
complete classification of the native tongues seems possible.
Clements R. Markham in the third edition of his exhaustive
list of the Amazonian tribes<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> has no less than 1087 entries.
He concludes that these may be referred to 485 distinct tribes
in all the periods, since the days of Acu&ntilde;a (1639). Deducting
some 111 as extinct or nearly so, the total amounts to "323 at
the outside" (p. 135). But for such linguistic differences, large
numbers of these groups would be quite indistinguishable from
each other, so great is the prevailing similarity in physical appearance
and usages in many districts. Thus Ehrenreich tells
us that, "despite their ethnico-linguistic differences, the tribes
about the head-waters of the Xingu present complete uniformity
in their daily habits, in the conditions of their existence, and
their general culture<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a>," though it is curious to note that the art
of making pottery is restricted here to the Arawak tribes<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
Yet amongst them are represented three of the radically distinct
linguistic groups of Brazil, some (Baka&iuml;ri and Nahuqua) belonging
to the Carib, some (Auet&ouml; and Kamayura) to the
Tupi-Guarani, and some (Mehinaku and Vaura) to the Arawak
family. Obviously these could not be so discriminated but for
their linguistic differences. On the other hand the opposite
phenomenon is occasionally presented of tribes differing considerably
in their social relations, which are nevertheless of the
same origin, or, what is regarded by Ehrenreich as the same
thing, belong to the same linguistic group. Such are the Ipurina,
the Paumari and the Yamamadi of the Purus valley, all grouped
as Arawaks because they speak dialects of the Arawakan stock
language. At the same time it should be noted that the social
differences observed by some modern travellers are often due
to the ever-increasing contact with the whites, who are now
encroaching on the Gran Chaco plains, and ascending every
Amazonian tributary in quest of rubber and the other natural
produce abounding in these regions. The consequent displacement
of tribes is discussed by G. E. Church<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a>.</p>

<p>In the introduction to his valuable list Clements Markham
observes that the evidence of language favours the theory that
the Amazonian tribes, "now like the sands on the sea-shore for
number, originally sprang from two or at most three parent
stocks. Dialects of the <i>Tupi</i> language extend from the roots
of the Andes to the Atlantic, and southward into Paraguay ...
and it is established that the differences in the roots, between
the numerous Amazonian languages, are not so great as was
generally supposed<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a>." This no doubt is true, and will account
for much. But when we see it here recorded that of the
Carabuyanas (Japura river) there are or were 16 branches, that
the Chiquito group (Bolivia) comprises 40 tribes speaking
"seven different languages"; that of the Juris (Upper Amazons)
there are ten divisions; of the Moxos (Beni and Mamor&eacute; rivers)
26 branches, "speaking nine or, according to Southey, thirteen
languages"; of the Uaup&eacute;s (Rio Negro) 30 divisions, and so
on, we feel how much there is still left to be accounted for.
Attempts have been made to weaken the force of the linguistic
argument by the assumption, at one time much in favour, that
the American tongues are of a somewhat evanescent nature,
in an unstable condition, often changing their form and structure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
within a few generations. But, says Powell, "this widely spread
opinion does not find warrant in the facts discovered in the
course of this research. The author has everywhere been
impressed with the fact that savage tongues are singularly persistent,
and that a language which is dependent for its existence
upon oral tradition is not easily modified<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a>." A test case is the
Delaware (Leni Lenap&eacute;), an Algonquian tongue which, judging
from the specimens collected by Th. Campanius about 1645,
has undergone but slight modification during the last 250 years.</p>

<p>In this connection the important point to be noticed is the
fact that some of the stock languages have an immense range,
while others are crowded together in indescribable confusion
in rugged upland valleys, or about river estuaries, or in the
recesses of trackless woodlands, and this strangely irregular
distribution prevails in all the main divisions of the continent.
Thus of Powell's 58 linguistic families in North America as
many as 40 are restricted to the relatively narrow strip of
coastland between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific, ten
are dotted round the Gulf of Mexico from Florida to the Rio
Grande, and two disposed round the Gulf of California, while
nearly all the rest of the land&mdash;some six million square miles&mdash;is
occupied by the six widely diffused Eskimauan, Athapascan,
Algonquian, Iroquoian, Siouan, and Shoshonian families. The
same phenomenon is presented by Central and South America,
where less than a dozen stock languages&mdash;Opatan, Nahuatlan,
Huastecan, Chorotegan, Quichuan, Arawakan, Gesan (Tapuyan),
Tupi-Guaranian, Cariban&mdash;are spread over millions
of square miles, while many scores of others are restricted to
extremely narrow areas. Here the crowding is largely determined,
as in Caucasia, by the altitude (Andes in Colombia,
Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia; Sierras in Mexico).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Culture.</div>

<p>It is strongly held by many American ethnologists that the
various cultures of America are autochthonous, nothing being
borrowed from the Old World. J. W. Powell<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a>,
who rendered such inestimable services to American
anthropology, affirmed that "the aboriginal peoples of
America cannot be allied preferentially to any one branch
of the human race in the Old World"; that "there is no
evidence that any of the arts of the American Indians were
borrowed from the Orient"; that "the industrial arts of America<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
were born in America, America was inhabited by tribes at the
time of the beginning of industrial arts. They left the Old World
before they had learned to make knives, spear and arrowheads,
or at least when they knew the art only in its crudest state.
Thus primitive man has been here ever since the invention of
the stone knife and the stone hammer." He further contended
that "the American Indian did not derive his forms of government,
his industrial or decorative arts, his languages, or his
mythological opinions from the Old World, but developed them
in the New"; and that "in the demotic characteristics of the
American Indians, all that is common to tribes of the Orient is
universal, all that distinguishes one group of tribes from another
in America distinguishes them from all other tribes of the
world."</p>

<p>This view has been emphasised afresh by Fewkes<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a>, though
of recent years it has met with vigorous opposition. At the
conclusion of his article "Die melanesische Bogenkultur und
ihre Verwandten<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a>" Graebner attempts to trace the cultural
connection of South America with South-east Asia rather than
with the South Seas, the main links being represented by head-hunting,
certain types of skin-drum and of basket, and in particular
three types of crutch-handled paddle. According to him
the spread of culture has taken place by the land route and
Behring Strait, not across the Pacific by way of the South Seas,
a view to which he adheres in his later work. An ingenious
and detailed attempt has also been made by Pater Schmidt<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> to
trace the various cultures determined for Oceania and Africa
in South America. Apart from the great linguistic groups
usually adopted as the basis of classification, Schmidt would
divide the South American Indians according to their stage of
economic development into collectors, cultivators, and civilised
peoples of the Andean highlands. Though this series may have
the appearance of evolution, in point of fact "each group is
composed of peoples differing absolutely in language and race,
who brought with them to South America in historically distinct
migrations at all events the fundamentals of their respective
cultures.... As we pass in review the cultural elements of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
separate groups, their weapons, implements, dwellings, their
sociology, mythology, and religion we discover the innate similarity
of these groups to the culture-zones of the Old World in
all essential features<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>." The author proceeds to work out his
theory in great detail; the earlier cultures he too considers have
travelled by the enormously lengthy land route by way of North
America, only the "free patrilineal culture" (Polynesia and
Indonesia) having reached the west coast directly by sea<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a>.</p>

<p>W. H. Holmes<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> draws attention to analogies between
American and foreign archaeological remains, for example the
stone gouge of New England and Europe. He hints at influences
coming from the Mediterranean and even from Africa.
"Even more remarkable and diversified are the correspondences
between the architectural remains of Yucatan and those of
Cambodia and Java in the far East. On the Pacific side of the
American continent strange coincidences occur in like degree,
seeming to indicate that the broad Pacific has not proved
a complete bar to intercourse of peoples of the opposing continents
... it seems highly probable considering the nature of the
archaeological evidence, that the Western World has not been
always and wholly beyond the reach of members of the white,
Polynesian, and perhaps even the black races."</p>

<p>Walter Hough<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> gives various cultural parallels between
America and the other side of the Pacific but does not commit
himself. S. Hagar<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> brings forward some interesting correspondences
between the astronomy of the New and of the Old
Worlds, but adopts a cautious attitude.</p>

<p>More recently the problem has been attacked with great
energy by G. Elliot Smith<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a>. His investigations into the processes
of mummification and the tombs of ancient Egypt led
him to comparative studies, and he notes that certain customs
seem to be found in association, forming what is known as a
culture-complex. For example, "in most regions the people
who introduced the habit of megalithic building and sun worship
also brought with them the practice of mummification." Also
associated with these are:&mdash;stories of dwarfs and giants, belief
in the indwelling of gods and great men in megalithic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
monuments, the use of these structures in a particular manner for
special council, the practice of hanging rags on trees in association
with such monuments, serpent worship, tattooing, distension
of the lobe of the ear, the use of pearls, the conch-shell
trumpet, etc. In a map showing the distribution of this "heliolithic"
culture-complex he indicates the main lines of migration
to America, one across the Aleutian chain and down the west
coast to California, the other and more important one, across
the Pacific to Peru, and thence to various parts of South
America, through Central America to the southern half of the
United States. Contrary to Schmidt, Elliot Smith postulates
contact of cultures rather than actual migrations of people; he
considers it possible that a small number of aliens arriving by
sea in Peru, for example, might introduce customs of a highly
novel and subversive character which would take root and
spread far and wide. The Peruvian custom of embalming the
dead certainly presents analogies to that of ancient Egypt,
and Elliot Smith is convinced that "the rude megalithic architecture
of America bears obvious evidence of the same inspiration
which prompted that of the Old World." In a later
paper Elliot Smith<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> adduces further evidence in support of his
thesis "that the essential elements of the ancient civilization of
India, Further Asia, the Malay Archipelago, Oceania, and
America were brought in succession to each of these places by
mariners, whose oriental migrations (on an extensive scale)
began as trading intercourse between the Eastern Mediterranean
and India some time after 800 <small>B.C.</small> and continued for many
centuries." This dissemination was in the first instance due to
the Phoenicians and there are "unmistakable tokens that the
same Phoenician methods which led to the diffusion of this
culture-complex in the Old World also were responsible for
planting it in the New<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> some centuries after the Phoenicians
themselves had ceased to be" (<i>l.c.</i> p. 27). Further evidence
along the same lines is offered by W. J. Perry<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> who has noted
the geographical distribution of terraced cultivation and irrigation
and finds that it corresponds to a remarkable extent
with that of the "heliolithic" culture-complex, and by J. Wilfrid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
Jackson<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> who has investigated the Aztec Moon-cult and its
relation to the Chank cult of India, the money cowry as a sacred
object among North American Indians<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a>, shell trumpets and
their distribution in the Old and New World<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> and the geographical
distribution of the shell purple industry<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a>. He points
out that we have ample evidence of the practice of this ancient
industry in several places in Central America, and refers
to Zelia Nuttall's interesting paper on the subject<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a>. Elliot
Smith also discusses "Pre-Columbian Representations of the
Elephant in America<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a>" and remarks "coincidences of so remarkable
a nature cannot be due to chance. They not only
confirm the identification of the elephant in designs in America,
but also incidentally point to the conclusion that the Hindu god
Indra was adopted in Central America with practically all the
attributes assigned to him in his Asiatic home." Elliot Smith
believes that practically every element of the early civilisation
of America was derived from the Old World. Small groups
of immigrants from time to time brought certain of the beliefs,
customs, and inventions of the Mediterranean area, Egypt,
Ethiopia, Arabia, Babylonia, Indonesia, Eastern Asia and
Oceania, and the confused jumble of practices became assimilated
and "Americanised" in the new home across the Pacific as the
result of the domination of the great uncultured aboriginal
populations by small bands of more cultured foreigners. These
highly suggestive studies will force adherents of the theory of
the indigenous origin of American culture to reconsider the
grounds for their opinions and will lead them to turn once more
to the writings of Bancroft<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a>, Tylor<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a>, Nuttall<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>, Macmillan Brown<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a>,

<div class="sidenote">Classification.</div>

<p>There is no satisfactory scheme of classification of the
American peoples. Although there is a good deal of scattered
information about the physical anthropology of the
natives it has not yet been systematised and no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>classification can at present be based thereon. A linguistic
classification is therefore usually adopted, but a geographical
or cultural grouping, or a combination of the two, has much
practical convenience. As Farrand<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> points out "It must never
be forgotten that the limits of physical, linguistic and cultural
groups do not correspond; and the overlapping of stocks determined
by those criteria is an unavoidable complication."</p>

<p>An inspection of the map of the distribution of linguistic
stocks of North America prepared by J. W. Powell<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> which
represents the probable state of affairs about
1500 <small>A.D.</small> shows that a few linguistic stocks have
a wide distribution while there is a large number
of restricted stocks crowded along the Pacific slope. The
following are the better known tribes of the more important
stocks together with their distribution.</p>

<p><i>Eskimauan</i> (Eskimo), along the Arctic coasts from 60&deg; N. lat.
in the west, to 50&deg; in the east. <i>Athapascan</i>, northern group,
D&eacute;n&eacute; or Tinneh (including many tribes), interior of Alaska,
northern British Columbia and the Mackenzie basin, and the
Sarsi of south-eastern Alberta and northern Montana; southern
group, Navaho and Apache in Arizona, New Mexico and
northern Mexico; the Pacific group, a small band in southern
British Columbia, others in Washington, Oregon and northern
California. <i>Algonquian</i>, south and west of Canada, the United
States east of the Mississippi, the whole valley of the Ohio,
and the states of the Atlantic coast. Blackfoot of Montana,
Alberta, south and further east, Cheyenne and Arapaho of
Minnesota. The main group of dialects is divided into the
Massachusett, Ojibway (Ojibway, Ottawa, Illinois, Miami, etc.)
and Cree types. The latter include the Cree, Montagnais,
Sauk and Fox, Menomini, Shawnee, Abnaki, etc. <i>Iroquoian</i>,
in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec; Hurons in the valley
of the St Lawrence and lake Simcoe. Neutral confederacy in
western New York and north and west of lake Erie. The
great confederacy of the Iroquois or "Five Nations" (Seneca,
Cayuga, Oneida, Onondaga and Mohawk, to which the Tuscarora
were added in 1712) in central New York; the Conestoga
and Susquehanna to the south. A southern group was located
in eastern Virginia and north Carolina, and the Cherokee,
centred in the southern Appalachians from parts of Virginia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
and Kentucky to northern Alabama. <i>Muskhogean</i> of Georgia,
Alabama and Mississippi, including the Choctaw, Chickasaw,
Creek, Seminole, etc. and the Natchez. There are several
small groups about the mouth of the Mississippi. <i>Caddoan</i>.
The earliest inhabitants of the central and southern plains
beyond the Missouri belonged to this stock, the largest group
occupied parts of Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas,
it consists of the Caddo, Wichita, etc. and the Kichai, the
Pawnee tribes in parts of Nebraska and Kansas and an offshoot,
the Arikara in North Dakota. <i>Siouan</i>, a small group in
Virginia, Carolina, Catawba, etc. and a very large group, practically
occupying the basins of the Missouri and Arkansas, with
a prolongation through Wisconsin, where were the Winnebago.
The main tribes are the Mandan, Crow, Dakota, Assiniboin,
Omaha and Osage. <i>Shoshonian</i> of the Great Plateau and
southern California. The two outlying tribes were the Hopi
of north Arizona and the Comanche who ranged over the
southern plains. Among the plateau tribes are the Ute, Shoshoni,
Mono and Luise&ntilde;o. <i>Yuman</i>, from Arizona to Lower
California.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethnic
Movements.</div>

<p>From the data available J. R. Swanton and R. B. Dixon
draw the following conclusions<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a>. "It appears that the origin
of the tribes of several of our stocks may be referred
back to a swarming ground, usually of rather
indefinite size but none the less roughly indicated.
That for the Muskhogeans, including probably some of the
smaller southern stocks, must be placed in Louisiana, Arkansas
and perhaps the western parts of Mississippi and Tennessee,
although a few tribes seem to have come from the region of
the Ohio. That for the Iroquoians would be along the Ohio
and perhaps farther west, and that of the Siouans on the lower
Ohio and the country to the north including part at least of
Wisconsin. The dispersion area for the Algonquians was
farther north about the Great Lakes and perhaps also the
St Lawrence, and that for the Eskimo about Hudson Bay or
between it and the Mackenzie river. The Caddoan peoples
seem to have been on the southern plains from earliest times.
On the north Pacific coast we have indications that the flow of
population has been from the interior to the coast. This seems
certain in the case of the Indians of the Chimmesayan stock
and some Tlinglit subdivisions. Some Tlinglit clans, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
have moved from the neighbourhood of the Nass northward.
Looking farther south we find evidence that the coast Salish
have moved from the inner side of the coast ranges, while a
small branch has subsequently passed northward to the west
of it. The Athapascan stock in all probability has moved
southward, sending one arm down the Pacific coast, and a
larger body presumably through the Plains which reached as
far as northern Mexico. Most of the stocks of the Great
Plateau and of Oregon and California show little evidence of
movement, such indications as are present, however, pointing
toward the south as a rule. The Pueblo Indians appear to
have had a mixed origin, part of them coming from the north,
part from the south. In general there is to be noted a striking
contrast between the comparatively settled condition of those
tribes west of the Rocky mountains and the numerous movements,
particularly in later times, of those to the east."</p>

<p>With regard to the Pacific coast Dixon<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> notes that it "has
apparently been occupied from the earliest times by peoples
differing but little in their culture from the tribes found in
occupancy in the sixteenth century. Cut off from the rest of
the country by the great chain of the Cordilleras and the inhospitable
and arid interior plateaus, the tribes of this narrow
coastal strip developed in comparative seclusion their various
cultures, each adopted to the environment in which it was
found....</p>

<p>"In several of the ingenious theories relating to the development
and origin of American cultures in general, it has been
contended that considerable migrations both of peoples and of
cultural elements passed along this coastal highway from north
to south. If, however, the archaeological evidence is to be
depended on, such great sweeping movements, involving many
elements of foreign culture, could hardly have taken place, for
no trace of their passage or modifying effect is apparent.... We
can feel fairly sure that the prehistoric peoples of each area
were in the main the direct ancestors of the local tribes of
today....</p>

<p>"In comparison with the relative simplicity of the archaeological
record on the Pacific coast, that of the eastern portion
of the continent is complex, and might indeed be best described
as a palimpsest. This complexity leads inevitably to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
conclusion that here there have been numerous and far-reaching
ethnic movements, resulting in a stratification of cultures."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Archaeological
Classification.</div>

<p>W. H. Holmes has compiled a map marking the limits of
eleven areas which can be recognised by their archaeological
remains<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a>. He points out that the culture units
are, as a matter of course, not usually well-defined.
Cultures are bound to over-lap and blend along the
borders and more especially along lines of ready communication.
In some cases evidence has been reported of early cultures
radically distinct from the type adopted as characteristic of the
areas, and ancestral forms grading into the later and into the
historic forms are thought to have been recognised. Holmes
frankly acknowledges the tentative character of the scheme,
which forms part of a synthesis that he is preparing of the
antiquities of the whole American continent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cultural
Classification.</div>

<p>North America is customarily divided into nine areas of
material culture, and though this is convenient, a more correct
method, as C. Wissler points out<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>, is to locate
the respective groups of typical tribes as culture
centres, classifying the other tribes as intermediate
or transitional. The geographical stability of the material
culture centres is confirmed by archaeological evidence which
suggests that the striking individuality they now possess resulted
from a more or less gradual expansion along original lines.
The material cultures of these centres possess great vitality
and are often able completely to dominate intrusive cultural
unity. Thus tribes have passed from an intermediate state to
a typical, as when the Cheyenne were forced into the Plains
centre, and the Shoshonian Hopi adopted the typical Pueblo
culture. Wissler comes to the conclusion that "the location
of these centres is largely a matter of ethnic accident, but once
located and the adjustments made, the stability of the environment
doubtless tends to hold each particular type of material
culture to its initial locality, even in the face of many changes
in blood and language." It is from his valuable paper that
the material culture traits of the following areas have been
obtained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eskimo:
Material
Culture.</div>

<p>I. Eskimo Area. The fact that the Eskimo live by the
sea and chiefly upon sea food does not differentiate them from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>the tribes of the North Pacific coast, but they are distinguished
from the latter by the habit of camping in winter upon sea
ice and living upon seal, and in the summer upon
land animals. The kayak and "woman's boat," the
lamp, harpoon, float, woman's knife, bowdrill, snow
goggles, trussed-bow, and dog traction are almost universal.
The type of winter shelter varies considerably, but the skin
tent is general in summer and the snow house, as a more
or less permanent winter house, prevails east of Point
Barrow.</p>

<p>The mode of life of all the Eskimo, as F. Boas<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> has pointed
out, is fairly uniform and depends on the distribution of food
at the different seasons. The migrations of game compel the
natives to move their habitations from time to time, and as
the inhospitable country does not produce vegetation to an
extent sufficient to support human life they are forced to depend
entirely upon animal food. The abundance of seals in Arctic
America enables man to withstand the inclemency of the climate
and the sterility of the soil. The skins of seals furnish the
materials for summer garments and for the tent, their flesh is
almost their only food, and their blubber their indispensable
fuel during the long dark winter when they live in solid snow
houses. When the ice breaks up in the spring the Eskimo
establish their settlements at the head of the fiords where
salmon are easily caught. When the snow on the land has
melted in July the natives take hunting trips inland in order
to obtain the precious skins of the reindeer, or of the musk-ox,
of whose heavy pelts the winter garments are made. Walrus
and the ground seal also arrive and birds are found in abundance
and eaten raw.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin and
Affinities.</div>

<p>The Eskimo<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> occupy more than 5000 miles of seaboard
from north-east Greenland to the mouth of the Copper river
in western Alaska. Many views have been advanced
as to the position of their centre of dispersion;
most probably it lay to the west of
Hudson Bay. Rink<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> is of opinion that they originated as a
distinct people in Alaska, where they developed an Arctic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
culture; but Boas<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> regards them "as, comparatively speaking,
new arrivals in Alaska, which they reached from the east."
A westward movement is supported by myths and customs,
and by the affinities of the Eskimo with northern Asiatics.
There was always hostility between the Eskimo and the North
American Indians, which, apart from their very specialised
mode of life, precluded any Eskimo extension southwards.
The expansion of the Eskimo to Greenland is explained by
Steensby<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> as follows:&mdash;the main southern movement would
have followed the west coast from Melville Bay, rounded the
southern point and proceeded some distance up the east coast.
From the Barren Grounds north-west of Hudson Bay the
Polar Eskimo followed the musk-ox, advanced due north to
Ellesmere Land, then crossed to Greenland, and, still hunting
the musk-ox, advanced along the north coast and down the
east coast towards Scoresby Sound. Another line of migration
apparently started from the vicinity of Southampton Island
and pursued the reindeer northwards into Baffin Land; on
reaching Ponds Inlet these reindeer-hunting Eskimo for the
most part turned along the east coast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physical
Type.</div>

<p>Physically the Eskimo constitute a distinct type. They
are of medium stature, but possess uncommon strength and
endurance; their skin is light brownish yellow
with a ruddy tint on the exposed parts; hands
and feet are small and well formed; their heads
are high, with broad faces, and narrow high noses, and eyes
of a Mongolian character. But great varieties are found in
different parts of the vast area over which they range. The
Polar Eskimo of Greenland, studied by Steensby, were more
of American Indian than of Asiatic type<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a>. Of their psychology
this writer says, "For the Polar Eskimos life is deadly real
and sober, a constant striving for food and warmth which is
borne with good humour, and all dispensations are accepted as
natural consequences, about which it is of no use to reason or
complain." "The hard struggle for existence has not permitted
the Polar Eskimo to become other than a confirmed
egoist, who knows nothing of disinterestedness. Towards his
enemies he is crafty and deceitful&mdash;he does not attack them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
openly, but indulges in backbiting.... It is only during the hunt
that a common interest and a common danger engender a
deeper feeling of comradeship<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a>."</p>

<p>Still less Mongolian in type are the "blond Eskimo" recently
encountered by Stef&aacute;nsson in south-west Victoria Island<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a>,
who are regarded by him as very possibly the mixed descendants
of Scandinavian ancestors who had drifted there from
west Greenland. It is known that Eric the Red discovered
Greenland in the year 982 and that 3 years later settlers went
there from the Norse colony in Iceland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Social Life.</div>

<p>The winter snow houses, which are about 12 &times; 15 ft. in
diameter and 12 ft. high, usually with annexes, are always
occupied by two families, each woman having
her own lamp and sitting on the ledge in front
of it. If more families join in making a snow house, they
make two main rooms. Whenever it is possible the men spend
the short days in hunting and each woman prepares the food
for her husband. The long nights are mainly spent in various
recreations. The social life in the summer settlement is somewhat
different. The families do not cook their own meals,
but a single one suffices for the whole settlement. The day
before it is her turn to cook the woman goes to the hills to
fetch enough shrubs for the fire. When a meal is ready the
master of the house calls out and everybody comes out of his
tent with a knife, the men sit in one circle and the women in
another. These dinners, which are always held in the evening,
are almost always enlivened by a mimic performance. The
great religious feasts take place just before the beginning of
winter.</p>

<p>There are three forms of social grouping: the Family,
House-mates, and Place-mates. (1) The family consists of
a man, his wife or wives, their children and adopted children;
widows and their children may be adopted, but the woman
retains her own fireplace. Sometimes men are adopted, such
as bachelors without any relatives, cripples, or impoverished
men. Joint ownership and use of a boat and house, and common
labour and toil in obtaining the means of support define the
real community of the family. (2) House-mates are families
that join together to build and occupy and maintain the same
house. This form of establishment is especially common in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
Greenland, but each family keeps its separate establishment
inside the common house. (3) Place-fellows. The inhabitants
of the same hamlet or winter establishment form one
community although no chief is elected or authority acknowledged.</p>

<p>Generally children are betrothed when very young. The
newly married pair usually live at first with the wife's family.
Both polygyny and polyandry occur. A man may lend or
exchange his wife for a whole season or longer, as a sign of
friendship. On certain occasions it is even commanded by
religious law. There is no government, but there is a kind of
chief in the settlement, though his authority is very limited.
He is called the "pimain," <i>i.e.</i> he who knows everything best.
He decides the proper time to shift the huts from one place
to another, he may ask some men to go sealing, others to go
deer hunting, but there is not the slightest obligation to obey
him. The men in a community may form themselves into an
informal council for the regulation of affairs. The decorative
art of the Eskimo is not remarkably developed, but the pictorial
art consists of clever sketches of everyday scenes and there is
a well developed plastic art. Many of the carvings are toys
and are made for the pleasure of the work. "The religious
views and practices of the Eskimo while, on the whole, alike
in their fundamental traits, show a considerable amount of
differentiation in the extreme east and in the extreme west.
It would seem that the characteristic traits of shamanism are
common to all the Eskimo tribes. The art of the shaman
(angakok) is acquired by the acquisition of guardian spirits....
Besides the spirits which may become guardian spirits of men,
the Eskimo believes in a great many others which are hostile
and bring disaster and death.... The ritualistic development of
Eskimo religion is very slight<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">D&eacute;n&eacute;:
Material
Culture.</div>

<p>II. Mackenzie Area. Skirting the Eskimo area is a belt
of semi-Arctic lands almost cut in two by Hudson Bay. To
the west are the D&eacute;n&eacute; tribes, who are believed
to fall into three culture groups, an eastern group,
Yellow Knives, Dog Rib, Hares, Slavey, Chipewyan
and Beaver; a south-western group, Nahane, Sekani,
Babine and Carrier; and a north-western group, comprising
the Kutchin, Loucheux, Ahtena and Khotana. The material<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
culture of the south-western group is deduced from the writings
of Father Morice<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a>. All the tribes are hunters of large or small
game, caribou are often driven into enclosures, small game
taken in snares or traps; various kinds of fish are largely used,
and a few of the tribes on the head waters of the Pacific take
salmon; large use of berries is made, they are mashed and
dried by a special process; edible roots and other vegetable
foods are used to some extent; utensils are of wood and bark;
there is no pottery; bark vessels are used for boiling with or
without stones; travel in summer is largely by canoe, in winter
by snowshoe; dog sleds are used to some extent, but chiefly
since trade days, the toboggan form prevailing; clothing is of
skins; mittens and caps are worn; there is no weaving except
rabbit-skin garments, but fine network occurs on snowshoes,
bags, and fish nets, materials being of bark fibre, sinew and
babiche; there is also a special form of woven quill work; the
typical habitation seems to be the double lean-to, though many
intrusive forms occur; other material culture traits include the
making of fish-hooks and spears; a limited use of copper;
and poorly developed work in stone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physical
Type.</div>

<p>The physical characteristics vary very much from tribe to
tribe. The Sekani, according to Morice, are slender and bony,
in stature rather below the average, with a narrow
forehead, hollow cheeks, prominent cheekbones,
small eyes deeply sunk in their orbit, the
upper lip very thin and the lower somewhat protruding, the
chin very small and the nose straight. The Carriers, on the
contrary, are tall and stout, without as a rule being too corpulent.
The men average 1.66 m. in height. Their forehead
is much broader than that of the Sekani, and less receding
than is usual with American aborigines. The face is full, and
the nose aquiline. All the tribes are remarkably unwarlike,
timid, and even cowardly. Weapons are seldom used and in
personal combat, which consists in a species of wrestling,
knives are previously laid aside. The fear of enemies is a
marked feature, due in part, doubtless, to traditional recollection
of the raids of earlier days. Their honesty is noted by all
travellers. Morice records that among the Sekani a trader
will sometimes go on a trapping expedition, leaving his store<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
unlocked, without fear of any of its contents going amiss.
Meantime a native may call in his absence, help himself to as
much powder and shot or any other item as he may need, but
he will never fail to leave there an exact equivalent in furs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Social Life.</div>

<p>The eastern D&eacute;n&eacute; are nomad hunters who gather berries
and roots, while the western are semi-sedentary, living for
most of the year in villages when they subsist
largely on salmon. The former are patrilineal
and the latter are grouped into matrilineal exogamic totemic
clans. The headmen of the clans formed a class of privileged
nobles who alone owned the hunting grounds. Morice speaks
of clan, honorific and personal totems. The first two were
adopted from coastal tribes, the honorific was assumed by some
individuals in order to attain a rank to which they were not
entitled by heredity. The "personal totem" is the guardian
spirit or genius, the belief in which is common to nearly all
North American peoples. Shamanism prevails throughout
the area. The mythology almost always refers to a "Transformer"
who visited the world when incomplete and set things
in order. They have the custom of the potlatch<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a>. If a man
desires another man's wife he can challenge the husband to a
wrestling match, the winner keeps the woman<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">N. Pacific
Coast: Material
Culture.</div>

<p>III. North Pacific Coast Area. This culture is rather
complex with tribal variations, but it can be treated under
three subdivisions, a northern group, Tlingit,
Haida and Tsimshian; a central group, the
Kwakiutl tribes and the Bellacoola; and a southern
group, the Coast Salish, Nootka, Chinook, Kalapooian,
Waiilatpuan, Chimakuan and some Athapascan tribes. The
first of these seem to be the type and are characterised by:
the great dependence upon sea food, some hunting upon the
mainland, large use of berries (dried fish, clams and berries
are the staple food); cooking with hot stones in boxes and
baskets; large rectangular gabled houses of upright cedar
planks with carved posts and totem poles; travel chiefly by
water in large seagoing dug-out canoes some of which had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
sails; no pottery nor stone vessels, except mortars; baskets
in checker, those in twine reaching a high state of excellence
among the Tlingit; coil basketry not made; mats of cedar
bark and soft bags in abundance; no true loom, the warp
hanging from a bar and weaving with the fingers downwards;
clothing rather scanty, chiefly of skin, a wide basket hat (the
only one of the kind on the continent, apparently for protection
against rain); feet usually bare, but skin moccasins and leggings
occasionally made; for weapons the bow, club and a peculiar
dagger, no lances; slat, rod and skin armour; wooden helmets,
no shields; practically no chipped stone tools, but nephrite
or green stone used; wood work highly developed; work in
copper possibly aboriginal but, if so, weakly developed. The
central group differs in a few minor points; twisted and loosely
woven bark or wool takes the place of skins for clothing and
baskets are all in checkerwork. Among the southern group
appears a strong tendency to use stone arrowheads, and a
peculiar flat club occurs, vaguely similar to the New Zealand
type<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physical
Type.</div>

<p>Physically the typical North Pacific tribes are of medium
stature, with long arms and short bodies. Among the northern
branches the stature averages 1.675 m. (5 ft. 6 in.),
the head is very large with an average index of
82.5. The face is very broad, the nose concave
or straight, seldom convex, with slight elevation. Among the
southern tribes, notably the Kwakiutl, the stature averages
1.645 m. (5 ft. 4&frac34; in.), the cephalic index is 84.5, the face very
broad but also of great length, the nose very high, rather
narrow and frequently convex.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Social Life.</div>

<p>The social relations of these peoples vary from tribe to
tribe, but on the whole they fall into a sequence from north to
south. In the northern portion descent is matrilineal,
but patrilineal in the south. J. G. Frazer
does not accept the view of Boas "that the Northern Kwakiutl
have borrowed both the rule of maternal descent and the
division into totemic clans from their more northerly neighbours
of alien stocks; in other words, that totemism and mother-kin
have spread southward among a people who had father-kin
and no totemic system<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a>." He inclines "to the other view,
formerly favoured by Boas himself, namely, that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
Kwakiutl are in a stage of transition from mother-kin to father-kin<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a>."</p>

<p>Each village is autonomous and originally may have been
restricted to a single totem clan. The population is divided
into three ranks, nobles, common people and a low caste consisting
of poor people and serfs who cannot participate in the
secret societies. In addition there is a totemic grouping. There
may be several totemic clans in one village and the same totem
may not only occur in every village, but may extend from one
tribe to another. This suggests that there were originally two,
or in some cases more than two, totemic clans which in process
of time became subdivided into sub-clans; these, while retaining
the crest of the original clan, acquired fresh ones, and the families
contained in each sub-clan may have their special crest or crests
in addition. New crests and names are constantly being introduced.
Marriage is forbidden between people of the same
crest, irrespective of the tribe. The natives according to Boas
do not consider themselves descendants from their totem. A
wife brings her father's position, crest and privileges as a dower
to her husband, who is not allowed to use them himself, but
acquires them for the use of his son, in other words this inheritance
is in the female line.</p>

<p>The widely spread American custom of a youth acquiring
a guardian spirit is far more prevalent among the southern
section than the northern, but among the Kwakiutl he can only
obtain as his patron, one or more of a limited number of spirits
which are hereditary in his clan. In the northern tribes the
secret societies are coextensive with the totemic clans; among
the Kwakiutl they are connected with guardian spirits and it
is significant that during the summer, when the people are
scattered, society is based on the old clan system, but when
the people live together in villages in the winter, society is
reorganised on the basis of the secret societies. There is a
highly developed system of barter of which the blanket is now
the unit of value, formerly the units were elk-skins, canoes or
slaves. Certain symbolic objects have attained fanciful values.
A vast credit system has grown up based on the custom of
loaning property at high interest, at the great festivals called
"potlatch" and by it the giver gains great honour. The religion
is closely related to the totemic beliefs; supernatural aid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
is given by the spirits to those who win their favour. The
raven is the chief figure in the mythology; he regulates the
phenomena of nature, procures fire, daylight, and fresh water,
and teaches men the arts.</p>

<p>To the south, and extending inland to the divide, forming
a much less characteristic group are the Salish or Flat-heads
who are allied to the Athapascans. The coastal Salish assimilate
the culture just described, but the plateau Salish are more
democratic, less settled and more individualistic in religious
matters<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a>. The Chinooks or Flat-heads of the lower reaches of
the Columbia river are nearly extinct. They deformed the
heads of infants. These tribes and the Shahapts or Nez Perc&eacute;s
are differentiated by garments of raw hides, cranial deformation,
absence of tattooing and plain bows, but they still have communal
houses though without totem posts. They cook by means
of heated stones and have zoomorphic masks<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plateau Area:
Material
Culture.</div>

<p>IV. Plateau Area. The Plateau area lies between the
North Pacific Coast area and the Plains. It is far less uniform
than either in its topography, the south being a
veritable desert while the north is moist and
fertile. The traits may be summarised as: extensive
use of salmon, deer, roots (especially camas) and berries;
the use of a handled digging stick, cooking with hot stones in
holes and baskets; the pulverisation of dried salmon and roots
for storage; winter houses, semi-subterranean, a circular pit
with a conical roof and smoke hole entrance; summer houses,
movable or transient, mat or rush-covered tents and the lean-to,
double and single; the dog sometimes used as a pack
animal; water transportation weakly developed, crude dug-outs
and bark canoes being used; pottery not known; basketry
highly developed, coil, rectangular shapes, imbricated technique;
twine weaving in flexible bags and mats; some simple weaving
of bark fibre for clothing; clothing for the entire body usually
of deerskins; skin caps for the men, and in some cases basket
caps for women; blankets of woven rabbit-skin; the sinew-backed
bow prevailed; clubs, lances, and knives, and rod and
slat armour were used in war, also heavy leather shirts; fish
spears, hooks, traps and bag nets were used; dressing of deerskins
highly developed; upright stretching frames and straight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
long handled scrapers; wood work more advanced than among
Plains tribes, but insignificant compared to North Pacific Coast
area; stone work confined to the making of tools and points,
battering and flaking; work in bone, metal, and feathers very
weak<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Interior
Salish.</div>

<p>Of the tribes of this area, the interior Salish, the Thompson,
Shushwap and Lillooet, appear to be the most typical of those
concerning which any information is available.
The Shahapts or Nez Perc&eacute;s, and the Shoshoni
show some marked Plains traits. "The interior
Salish are landsmen and hunters, and from time immemorial
have been accustomed to follow their game over mountainous
country. This mode of life has engendered among them an
active, slender, athletic type of men; they are considerably
taller and possess a much finer physique than their congeners
of the coastal region, who are fishermen, passing the larger
portion of their time on the water squatting in their canoes,
never walking to any place if they can possibly reach it by
water. The typical coast Salish are a squat thick-set people,
with disproportionate legs and bodies, slow and heavy in their
movements, and as unlike their brothers of the interior as it
is possible for them to be<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>."</p>

<p>The Thompsons represented the Salish at their highest
and best, both morally and physically, and their ethical precepts
and teaching set a very high standard of virtue before the
advent of the Europeans. Hill-Tout says that receptiveness
and a wholesale adoption of foreign fashions and customs are
their striking qualities, and "if they have fallen away from
these high standards, as we fear they have, the fault is not
theirs but ours.... We assumed a grave responsibility when we
undertook to civilise these races<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Social Organisation.</div>

<p>The simplest form of social organisation is found among
the interior hunting tribes, where a state of pure anarchy may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>be said to have formerly prevailed, each family being a law
unto itself and acknowledging no authority save
that of its own elderman. Each local community
was composed of a greater or less number
of these self-ruling families. There was a kind of headship or
nominal authority given to the oldest and wisest of the eldermen
in some of the larger communities, where occasion called
for it or where circumstances arose in which it became necessary
to have a central representative. This led in some centres to
the regular appointing of local chiefs or heads whose business
it was to look after the material interest of the commune over
which they presided; but the office was always strictly elective
and hedged with manifold limitations as to authority and
privilege. For example, the local chief was not necessarily
the head of all undertakings. He would not lead in war or
the chase unless he happened to be the best hunter or the
bravest and most skilful warrior among them; and he was
subject to deposition at a moment's notice if his conduct did
not meet with the approval of the elders of the commune.
His office or leadership was therefore purely a nominal one.
All hunting, fishing, root, and berry grounds were common
property and shared in by all alike....  In one particular tribe
even the food was held and meals were taken in common, the
presiding elder or headman calling upon a certain family each
day to provide and prepare the meals for all the rest, every one,
more or less, taking it in turn to discharge this social duty<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">California:
Material
Culture.</div>

<p>V. Californian Area. Of the four sub-culture areas noted
by Kroeber<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> the central group is the most extensive and typical.
Its main characteristics are: acorns as the chief
vegetable food, supplemented by wild seeds,
while roots and berries are scarcely used; the
acorns are made into bread by a roundabout process; hunting
is mostly of small game, fishing wherever possible; the houses
are of many forms, all simple shelters of brush or tule, or more
substantial conical lean-to structures of poles; the dog was not
used for packing and there were no canoes, but rafts of tule
were used for ferrying; no pottery but high development of
basketry both coil and twine; bags and mats scanty; cloth or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
other weaving of simple elements not known; clothing simple
and scanty; feet usually bare; the bow the only weapon, usually
sinew-backed; work in skins, wood, bone etc., weak, in metals
absent, in stone work not advanced. In the south modifications
enter with large groups of Yuman and Shoshonian tribes where
pottery, sandals and wooden war clubs are intrusive. The
extinct Santa Barbara were excellent workers in stone, bone
and shell, and made plank canoes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Social Life.</div>

<p>Topographical variation produces consequent changes in
mode of life as the well watered and wooded country of Oregon
and Northern California gradually merges into
the warm dry climate of South California with
decreasing moisture towards the tropics. As Kroeber says<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a>,
"From the time of the first settlement of California, its Indians
have been described as both more primitive and more peaceful
than the majority of the natives of North America.... The
practical arts of life, the social institutions and the ceremonies
of the Californian Indians are unusually simple and undeveloped.
There was no war for its own sake, no confederation of powerful
tribes, no communal stone pueblos, no totems, or potlatches.
The picturesqueness and the dignity of the Indians are lacking.
In general rudeness of culture the Californian Indians are
scarcely above the Eskimo.... If the degree of civilisation attained
by people depends in any large measure on their habitat,
as does not seem likely, it might be concluded from the case
of the Californian Indians that natural advantages were an
impediment rather than an incentive to progress.... It is possible
to speak of typical Californian Indians and to recognise a typical
Californian culture area. A feature that should not be lost
sight of is the great stability of population.... The social organisation
was both simple and loose.... Beyond the family the
only bases of organisation were the village and the language."
In so simple a condition of society difference of rank naturally
found but little scope. The influence of chiefs was comparatively
small, and distinct classes, as of nobility or slaves, were
unknown. Individual property rights were developed and what
organisation of society there was, was largely on the basis of
property. The ceremonies are characterised by a very slight
development of the extreme ritualism that is so characteristic
of the American Indians, and by an almost entire absence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
symbolism of any kind. Fetishism is also unusual. One set
of ceremonies was usually connected with a secret religious
society; during initiation members were disguised by feathers
and paint, but masks were not worn. There was also an annual
tribal spectacular ceremony held in remembrance of the dead.
In the north-west portion of the state a somewhat more highly
developed and specialised culture existed which has some
affinities with that of the north-west tribes, as is indicated by
a greater advance in technology, a social organisation largely
upon a property basis and a system of mythology that is suggestive
of those further north. The now extinct tribes of the
Santa Barbara islands and adjacent mainland were more advanced.
They alone employed a plank-built canoe instead of
the balsas or canoe-shaped bundles of rushes of the greater
part of California. They made stone bowls and did inlaid work.
Like the North Californians and tribes further north they
buried instead of burning their dead. The eastern tribes shade
off into their neighbours. The Luise&ntilde;o, the southernmost of
the Shoshonians, had puberty rites for girls and boys<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a>. The
belief in a succession of births "is reminiscent of Oceanic and
Asiatic ways of thought<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a>." [About] 1788 a secret cult arose
inculcating, with penalties, obedience, fasting, and self-sacrifice
on initiates<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plains Area:
Material
Culture.</div>

<p>VI. Plains Area. The chief traits of this culture are the
dependence upon the bison ("buffalo") and the very limited
use of roots and berries; absence of fishing; lack
of agriculture; the <i>tipi</i> or tent as the movable
dwelling and transportation by land only, with
the dog and the travois (in historic times, with the horse); no
baskets, pottery, or true weaving; clothing of bison and deerskins;
there is high development of work in skins and special
bead technique and raw-hide work (parfleche, cylindrical bag
etc.), and weak development of work in wood, stone and bone.
This typical culture is manifested in the Assiniboin, Arapaho,
Blackfoot, Crow, Cheyenne, Comanche, Gros Ventre, Kiowa,
Kiowa-Apache, Sarsi and Teton-Dakota<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a>. Among the tribes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
of the eastern border a limited use of pottery and basketry
may be added, some spinning and weaving of bags, and rather
extensive agriculture. Here the tipi alternates with larger and
more permanent houses covered with grass, bark or earth, and
there was some attempt at water transportation. These tribes
are the Arikara, Hidatsa, Iowa, Kansa, Mandan, Missouri,
Omaha, Osage, Oto, Pawnee, Ponca, Santee-Dakota<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a>, Yankton-Dakota<a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a>
and Wichita.</p>

<p>On the western border other tribes (Wind River Shoshoni,
Uinta and Uncompahgre Ute) lack pottery but produce a
rather high type of basketry, depending far less on the bison
but more on deer and small game, making large use of wild
grass seeds.</p>

<p>On the north-eastern border the Plains-Ojibway and Plains-Cree
combine many traits of the forest hunting tribes with
those found in the Plains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Dakota
(Sioux).</div>

<p>The Dakota or Sioux are universally conceded to be of
the highest type, physically, mentally and probably morally of
any of the western tribes. Their bravery has
never been questioned by white or Indian and
they conquered or drove out every rival except
the Ojibway. Their physical characteristics are as follows:
dark skin faintly tinged with red, facial features more strongly
marked than those of the Pacific Coast Indians, nose and lower
jaw particularly prominent and heavy, head generally mesocephalic
and not artificially deformed. They are a free and
dominant race of hunters and warriors, necessarily strong and
active. Their weapons of stone, wood, bone and horn are tomahawk,
club, flint knife, and bow and arrow. All their habits
centre in the bison, which provided the staple materials of
nutrition and industry. Drawing and painting were done on
prepared bison skins and elaborately carved pipes were made
for ceremonial use.</p>

<p>They are divided into kinship groups, with inheritance as
a rule in the male line. The woman is autocrat of the home.
Exogamy was strictly enforced in the clan but marriage within
the tribe or with related tribes was encouraged. The marriage
was arranged by the parents and polygyny was common where
means would permit. Government consisted in chieftainship
acquired by personal merit, and the old men exercised considerable
influence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion.</div>

<p>Religious conceptions were based on a belief in <i>Wakonda</i>
or <i>Manito</i><a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a>, an all-pervading spirit force, whose cult involved
various shamanistic ceremonials consisting of
dancing, chanting, feasting and fasting. Most
distinctive of these is the Sun dance, practised by almost all
the tribes of the plains except the Comanche. It is an annual
festival lasting several days, in honour of the sun, for the
purpose of obtaining abundant produce throughout the
year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sun
Dance.</div>

<p>The Sun dance was not only the greatest ceremony of the
Plains tribes but was a condition of their existence. More than
any other ceremony or occasion, it furnished the
tribe the opportunity for the expression of emotion
in rhythm, and was the occasion of the tribe becoming
more closely united. It gave opportunity for the making
and renewing of common interests, the inauguration of tribal
policies, and the renewing of the rank of the chiefs; for the
exhibition, by means of mourning feasts, of grief over the loss
of members of families; for the fulfilment of social obligations
by means of feasts; and, finally, for the exercise and gratification
of the emotions of love on the part of the young in the
various social dances which always formed an interesting feature
of the ceremony<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a>.</p>

<p>Being strongly opposed by the missionaries because it was
utterly misunderstood<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a>, and finding no favour in official circles,
the Sun dance has been for many years an object of persecution,
and in consequence is extinct among the Dakota, Crows, Mandan,
Pawnee, and Kiowa, but it is still performed by the Cree,
Siksika (Blackfoot), Arapaho, Cheyenne, Assiniboin, Ponca,
Shoshoni and Ute, though in many of these tribes its disappearance
is near at hand, for it has lost part of its rites and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
has become largely a spectacle for gain rather than a great
religious ceremony<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pawnee.</div>

<p>The Pawnee do not differ at all widely from the Dakota,
but have a somewhat finer cast of features. They are more
given to agriculture, raising crops of maize, pumpkins,
etc. The Pawnee type of hut is characteristic,
consisting of a circular framework of poles or logs, covered
with brush, bark and earth. Their religious ceremonies were
connected with the cosmic forces and the heavenly bodies.
The dominating power was Tirawa generally spoken of as
"Father." The winds, thunder, lightning and rain were his
messengers. Among the Skidi the morning and evening stars
represented the masculine and feminine elements, and were
connected with the advent and perpetuation on earth of all
living forms. A series of ceremonies relative to the bringing
of life and its increase began with the first thunder in the
spring and culminated at the summer solstice in human sacrifice,
but the series did not close until the maize, called "mother
corn," was harvested. At every stage of the series certain
shrines or "bundles" became the centre of a ceremony. Each
shrine was in charge of an hereditary keeper, but its rituals
and ceremonies were in the keeping of a priesthood open to
all proper aspirants. Through the sacred and symbolic articles
of the shrines and their rituals and ceremonies a medium of
communication was believed to be opened between the people
and the supernatural powers, by which food, long life and
prosperity were obtained. The mythology of the Pawnee is
remarkably rich in symbolism and poetic fancy and their religious
system is elaborate and cogent. The secret societies,
of which there were several in each tribe, were connected with
the belief in supernatural animals. The functions of these
societies were to call the game, to heal diseases, and to give
occult powers. Their rites were elaborate and their ceremonies
dramatic<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Blackfeet.</div>

<p>The Blackfeet or Siksika<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a>, an Algonquian confederacy of
the northern plains, agree in culture with the Plains tribes
generally, though there is evidence of an earlier
culture, approximately that of the eastern woodland
tribes. They are divided into the Siksika
proper, or Blackfeet, the Kainah or Bloods, and the Piegan,
the whole being popularly known as Blackfoot or Blackfeet.
Formerly bison and deer were their chief food and there is no
evidence that they ever practised agriculture, though tobacco
was grown and used entirely for ceremonial purposes. The
doors of their tipis always faced east. They have a great
number of dances&mdash;religious, war and social&mdash;besides secret
societies for various purposes, together with many "sacred
bundles" around every one of which centres a ritual. Practically
every adult has his personal "medicine." The principal
deities are the Sun, and a supernatural being known as <i>Napi</i>
"Old Man," who may be an incarnation of the same idea.
The religious activity of a Blackfoot consists in putting himself
into a position where the cosmic power will take pity upon him
and give him something in return. There was no conception
of a single personal god<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Arapaho.</div>

<p>The Arapaho, another Algonquian Plains tribe, were once
according to their own traditions a sedentary agricultural people
far to the north of their present range, apparently
in North Minnesota. They have been closely
associated with the Cheyenne for many generations<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a>. The
annual Sun Dance is their greatest tribal ceremony, and they
were active propagators of the ghost-dance religion of the last
century which centred in the belief in the coming of a messiah
and the restoration of the country to the Indians<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Cheyenne.</div>

<p>The Cheyenne, also of agricultural origin, have been for
generations a typical prairie tribe, living in skin tipis, following
the bison over large areas, travelling and fighting
on horseback. In character they are proud, contentious,
and brave to desperation, with an exceptionally high
standard for women. Under the old system they had a council
of 44 elective chiefs, of whom four constituted a higher body,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
with power to elect one of their number as head chief of the
tribe. In all councils that concerned the relations with other
tribes, one member of the council was appointed to argue
as proxy or "devil's advocate" for the alien people. The
council of 44 is still symbolised by a bundle of 44 invitation
sticks, kept with the sacred medicine-arrows, and formerly sent
round when occasion arose to convene the assembly. The
four medicine-arrows constitute the tribal palladium which they
claim to have had from the beginning of the world. It was
exposed once a year with appropriate rites, and is still religiously
preserved. No woman, white man, or even mixed blood of
the tribe has ever been allowed to come near the sacred arrows.
In priestly dignity the keepers of the medicine-arrows and the
priests of the Sun dance rites stood first and equal<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a>.</p>

<p>VII. Eastern Woodland Area<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a>. The culture north of the
Great Lakes and east of the St Lawrence is comparable to
that of the D&eacute;n&eacute; (see p. 361), the main traits
being: the taking of caribou in pens; the snaring
of game; the importance of small game and fish,
also of berries; the weaving of rabbit-skins; the birch canoe;
the toboggan; the conical skin or bark-covered shelter; the
absence of basketry and pottery and the use of bark and
wooden utensils. To this northern group belong the Ojibway
north of the lakes, including the Saulteaux, the Wood Cree,
the Montagnais and the Naskapi. Further south the main
body falls into three large divisions: Iroquoian tribes (Huron,
Wyandot, Erie, Susquehanna and Five Nations); Central
Algonquian to the west of the Iroquois (some Ojibway, Ottawa,
Menomini, Sauk and Fox<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a>, Potawatomi, Peoria, Illinois, Kickapoo,

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Central Group.</div>

<p>The Central group west of the Iroquois appears to be the
most typical and the best known and the following are the
main culture traits: maize, squashes and bean
were cultivated, wild rice where available was a
great staple, and maple sugar was manufactured; deer, bear
and even bison were hunted; also wild fowl; fishing was fairly
developed, especially sturgeon fishing on the lakes; pottery
poor, but formerly used for cooking vessels, vessels of wood
and bark common; some splint basketry; two types of shelter
prevailed, a dome-shaped bark or mat-covered lodge for winter
and a rectangular bark house for summer, though the Ojibway
used the conical type of the northern border group; dug-out
and bark canoes and snowshoes were used, occasionally the
toboggan and dog traction; weaving was of bark fibre (downward
with fingers), and soft bags, pack lines and fish nets were
made; clothing was of skins; soft-soled moccasins with drooping
flaps, leggings, breech-cloth and sleeved shirts for men, for
women a skirt and jacket, though a one-piece dress was known;
robes of skin or woven rabbit-skin; no armour or lances; bows
of plain wood and clubs; in trade days, the tomahawk; work
in wood, stone and bone weakly developed; probably considerable
use of copper in prehistoric times; feather-work rare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eastern Group.</div>

<p>In the eastern group agriculture was more intensive (except
in the north) and pottery was more highly developed.
Woven feather cloaks were common, there was
a special development of work in steatite, and
more use was made of edible roots.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Iroquoian
Tribes.</div>

<p>The Iroquoian tribes were even more intensive agriculturalists
and potters. They made some use of the blow-gun,
developed cornhusk weaving, carved elaborate
masks from wood, lived in rectangular houses of
peculiar pattern, built fortifications and were
superior in bone work<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Ojibway.</div>

<p>In physical type the Ojibways<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a>, who may be taken as typical
of the central Algonquians, were 1.73 m. (5 ft. 8 in.) in height,
with brachycephalic heads (82 in the east, 80 in
the west, but variable), heavy strongly developed
cheek-bones and heavy and prominent nose. They were hard
fighters and beat back the raids of the Iroquois on the east and
of the Foxes on the south, and drove the Sioux before them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
out upon the Plains. According to Schoolcraft, who was personally
acquainted with them and married a woman of the
tribe, the warriors equalled in physical appearance the best
formed of the North-West Indians, with the possible exception
of the Foxes.</p>

<p>They were organised in many exogamous clans; descent
was patrilineal although it was matrilineal in most Algonquian
tribes. The clan system was totemic. There was a clan chief
and generally a tribal chief as well, chosen from one clan in
which the office was hereditary. His authority was rather
indefinite.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion.</div>

<p>As regards religion W. Jones<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> notes their belief in a cosmic
mystery present throughout all Nature, called "Manito." It
was natural to identify the Manito with both
animate and inanimate objects and the impulse
was strong to enter into personal relations with the mystic
power. There was one personification of the cosmic mystery;
and this was an animate being called the Great Manito. Although
they have long been in friendly relations with the
whites Christianity has had but little effect on them, largely
owing to the conservatism of the native medicine-men. The
<i>Medewiwin</i>, or grand medicine society, was a powerful organisation,
which controlled all the movements of the tribe<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Iroquois.</div>

<p>The Iroquois<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> are not much differentiated in general culture
from the stocks around them, but in political development
they stand unique. The Five Nations, Mohawk,
Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga and Seneca
(subsequently joined by the Tuscarora), formed the famous
League of the Iroquois about the year 1570. Each tribe remained
independent in matters of local concern, but supreme
authority was delegated to a council of elected sachems. They
were second to no other Indian people north of Mexico in
political organisation, statecraft and military prowess, and their
astute diplomats were a match for the wily French and English
statesmen with whom they treated. So successful was this
confederacy that for centuries it enjoyed complete supremacy
over its neighbours, until it controlled the country from Hudson
Bay to North Carolina. The powerful Ojibway at the end of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
Lake Superior checked their north-west expansion, and their
own kindred the Cherokee stopped their progress southwards.</p>

<p>The social organisation was as a rule much more complex
and cohesive than that of any other Indians, and the most
notable difference was in regard to the important position
accorded to the women. Among the Cherokee, the Iroquois
and the Hurons the women performed important and essential
functions in their government. Every chief was chosen and
retained his position and every important measure was enacted
by the consent and cooperation of the child-bearing women,
and the candidate for a chieftainship was nominated by the
suffrages of the matrons of this group. His selection from
among their sons had to be confirmed by the tribal and the
federal councils respectively, and finally he was installed into
office by federal officers. Lands and the "long houses" of
related families belonged solely to the women.</p>

<div class="sidenote">South-eastern
Area: Material
Culture.</div>

<p>VIII. South-eastern Area. This area is conveniently
divided by the Mississippi, the typical culture occurring in the
east. The Powhatan group and the Shawnee
are intermediate, and the chief tribes are the
Muskhogean (Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole,
etc.) and Iroquoian tribes (Cherokee and Tuscarora)
with the Yuchi, Eastern Siouan, Tunican and Quapaw. The
main culture traits are: great use of vegetable food and intensive
agriculture; maize, cane (a kind of millet), pumpkins,
watermelons and tobacco being raised. Large use of wild
vegetables, the dog, the only domestic animal, eaten; later
chickens, hogs, horses and cattle quickly adopted; large
game, deer, bear and bison, in the west; turkeys and small
game also hunted; some fishing (with fish poison); of manufactured
foods bears' oil, hickory-nut oil, persimmon bread and
hominy are noteworthy, together with the famous black drink<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a>;
houses generally rectangular with curved roofs, covered with
thatch or bark, often with plaster walls, reinforced with wicker
work; towns were fortified with palisades; dug-out canoes
were used for transport. Clothing chiefly of deerskins and
bison robes, shirt-like garments for men, skirts and toga-like,
upper garments for women, boot-like moccasins in winter;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
there were woven fabrics of bark fibre, fine netted feather
cloaks, and some bison hair weaving in the west (the weaving
being downwards with the fingers); baskets of cane and splints,
the double or netted basket and the basket meal sieve being
special forms; knives of cane, darts of cane and bone; blow-guns
in general use; pottery good, coil process, with paddle
decorations; a particular method of skin dressing (macerated
in mortars), good work in stone, but little in metal<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Creeks.</div>

<p>The Creek women were short though well formed, while
the warrior according to Pickett<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> was "larger than the ordinary
race of Europeans, often above 6 ft. in height,
but was invariably well formed, erect in his carriage,
and graceful in every movement. They were proud,
haughty and arrogant, brave and valiant in war." As a people
they were more than usually devoted to decoration and ornament;
they were fond of music and ball play was their most
important game. Each Creek town had its independent
government, under an elected chief who was advised by the
council of the town in all important matters. Certain towns
were consecrated to peace ceremonies and were known as
"white towns," while others, set apart for war ceremonials,
were known as "red towns." The solemn annual festival of
the Creeks was the "busk" or <i>puskita</i>, a rejoicing over the
first-fruits of the year. Each town celebrated its busk whenever
the crops had come to maturity. All the worn-out clothes,
household furniture, pots and pans and refuse, grain and other
provisions were gathered together into a heap and consumed.
After a fast, all the fires in the town were extinguished and
a priest kindled a new fire from which were made all the
fires in the town. A general amnesty was proclaimed, all
malefactors might return to their towns and their offences
were forgiven. Indeed the new fire meant the new life, physical
and moral, which had to begin with the new year<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Yuchi.</div>

<p>The Yuchi houses are grouped round a square plot of
ground which is held as sacred, and here the religious ceremonies
and social gatherings take place. On the
edges stand four ceremonial lodges, in conformity
with the four cardinal points, in which the different clan groups<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
have assigned places. The square ground symbolises the rainbow,
where in the sky-world, Sun, the mythical culture-hero,
underwent the ceremonial ordeals which he handed down to
the first Yuchi. The Sun, as chief of the sky-world, author
of the life, the ceremonies and the culture of the people, is by
far the most important figure in their religious life. Various
animals in the sky-world and vegetation spirits are recognised,
besides the totemic ancestral spirits, who play an important
part.</p>

<p>According to Speck<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> "the members of each clan believe
that they are relatives and, in some vague way, the descendants
of certain pre-existing animals whose names and identity they
now bear. The animal ancestors are accordingly totemic. In
regard to the living animals, they, too, are the earthly types
and descendants of the pre-existing ones, hence, since they
trace their descent from the same sources as the human clans,
the two are consanguinely related." Thus the members of a
clan feel obliged not to do violence to the wild animals having
the form or name of their tutelaries, though the flesh and fur
may be obtained from the members of other clans who are
under no such obligations. The different individuals of the
clan inherit the protection of the clan totems at the initiatory
rites, and thenceforth retain them as their protectors through
life.</p>

<p>Public religious worship centres in the complex annual
ceremony connected with the corn harvest and includes the
making of new fire, clan dances impersonating totemic ancestors,
dances to propitiate maleficent spirits and acknowledge
the assistance of beneficent ones in the hope of a continuance
of their benefits, scarification of the males for sacrifice and
purification, taking an emetic as a purifier, the partaking of
the first green corn of the season, and the performance of a
characteristic ball game with two sticks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mound
Builders.</div>

<p>The middle and lower portions of the Mississippi valley
with out-lying territories exhibit archaeological evidence of a
remarkable culture, higher than that of any other
area north of Mexico. This culture was characterised
by "well established sedentary life, extensive
practice of agricultural pursuits, and construction of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
permanent works&mdash;domiciliary, religious, civic, defensive and
mortuary, of great magnitude and much diversity of form."
The people, some, if not all of whom were mound-builders,
were of numerous linguistic stocks, Siouan, Algonquian, Iroquoian,
Muskhogean, Tunican, Chitimachan, Caddoan and
others, and "these historic peoples, remnants of which are
still found within the area, were doubtless preceded by other
groups not of a distinct race but probably of the same or
related linguistic families. This view, in recent years, has
gradually taken the place of the early assumption that the
mound culture belonged to a people of high cultural attainments
who had been succeeded by Indian tribes. That mound
building continued down to the period of European occupancy
is a well established fact, and many of the burial mounds
contain as original inclusions articles of European make<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a>."</p>

<p>These general conclusions are in no way opposed to De
Nadaillac's suggestion that the mounds were certainly the work
of Indians, but of more civilised tribes than the present Algonquians,
by whom they were driven south to Florida, and there
found with their towns, council-houses, and other structures
by the first white settlers<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a>. It would appear, however, from
F. H. Cushing's investigations, that these tribal council-houses
of the Seminole Indians were a local development, growing
up on the spot under conditions quite different from those
prevailing in the north. Many of the vast shell-mounds, especially
between Tampa and Cape Sable, are clearly of artificial
structure, that is, made with definite purpose, and carried up
symmetrically into large mounds comparable in dimensions
with the Indian mounds of the interior. They originated with
pile dwellings in shallow water, where the kitchen refuse, chiefly
shells, accumulates and rises above the surface, when the
building appears to stand on posts in a low mound. Then this
type of structure comes to be regarded as the normal for house-building
everywhere. "Through this natural series of changes
in type there is a tendency to the development of mounds as
sites for habitations and for the council-house of the clan or
tribe, the sites being either separate mounds or single large
mounds, according to circumstances. Thus the study of the
living Seminole Indians and of the shell-mounds in the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
vicinity ... suggests a possible origin for a custom of mound-building
at one time so prevalent among the North American
Indians<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a>." But if this be the genesis of such structures, the
custom must have spread from the shores of the Gulf inland,
and not from the Ohio valley southwards to Florida.</p>

<div class="sidenote">South-western
Area: Material
Culture.</div>

<p>IX. South-western Area. On account of its highly developed
state and its prehistoric antecedents, the Pueblo
culture appears as the type, though this is by no
means uniform in the different villages. Three
geographical groups may be recognised, the
Hopi<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a>, the Zu&ntilde;i<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> and the Rio Grande<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a>.</p>

<p>The culture of the whole may be characterised by: main
dependence upon maize and other cultivated foods (men doing
the cultivating and cloth-weaving instead of women); use of
a grinding stone instead of a mortar; the art of masonry;
loom or upward weaving; cultivated cotton as a textile material;
pottery decorated in colour; unique style of building
and the domestication of the turkey. Though the main dependence
was on vegetable food there was some hunting; the
eastern villages hunted bison and deer, especially Taos. Drives
of rabbits and antelopes were practised, the unique hunting
weapon being the curved rabbit stick. Woven robes were
usual. Men wore aprons and a robe when needed. Women
wore a garment reaching from shoulder to knee fastened on
the right shoulder only. In addition to cloth robes some were
woven of rabbit-skin and some netted with turkey feathers.
Hard-soled moccasins were worn, those for women having
long strips of deerskin wound round the leg. Pottery was
highly developed, not only for practical use. Basketry was
known but not so highly developed as among the non-Pueblo
tribes. The dog was not used for transportation and there
were no boats. Work in stone and wood not superior to that
of other areas; some work in turquoise, but none in metal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transitional or
Intermediate
Tribes.</div>

<p>Many tribes appear to be transitional to the Pueblo type.
Thus the Pima once lived in adobe houses, though not of
Pueblo type, they developed irrigation but also made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>extensive use of wild plants, raised cotton, wove cloth, were
indifferent potters but experts in basketry. The
Mohave, Yuma, Cocopa, Maricopa and Yavapai
built a square flat-roofed house of wood, had no
irrigation, were not good basket-makers (except the Yavapai)
but otherwise resembled the Pima. The Walapai and Havasupai
were somewhat more nomadic.</p>

<p>The Athapascan tribes to the east show intermediate
cultures. The Jicarilla and Mescalero used the Plains tipi,
gathered wild vegetable food, hunted bison, had no agriculture
or weaving, but dressed in skins, and had the glass-bead
technique of the Plains. The western Apache differed little
from these, but rarely used tipis and gave a little more attention
to agriculture. In general the Apache have certain
undoubted Pueblo traits, they also remind one of the Plains,
the Plateaus, and, in a lean-to like shelter, of the Mackenzie
area. The Navaho seem to have taken their most striking
features from European influence, but their shelter is of the
northern type, while costume, pottery and feeble attempts at
basketry and formerly at agriculture suggest Pueblo influence<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pueblos.</div>

<p>Pueblo culture takes its name from the towns or villages
of stone or adobe houses which form the characteristic feature
of the area. These vary according to the locality,
those in the north being generally of sandstone,
while adobe or sun-dried brick was employed to the south.
The groups of dwellings were generally compact structures of
several stories, with many small rooms, built in terrace fashion,
the roof of one storey forming a promenade for the storey next
above. Thus from the front the structure is like a gigantic
staircase, from the back a perpendicular wall. The upper
houses were and still are reached by means of movable ladders
and a hatchway in the roof. Mainly in the north but scattered
throughout the area are the remains of dwellings built in
natural recesses of cliffs, while in some places the cliff face is
honeycombed with masonry to provide habitations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cliff Dwellings.</div>

<p>Although doubtless designed for purposes of hiding and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>defence, many of the cliff houses were near streams and fields
and were occupied because they afforded shelter
and were natural dwelling places; many were
storage places for maize and other property: others again
were places for outlook from which the fields could be watched
or the approach of strangers observed. In some districts
evidence of post-Spanish occupancy exists. From intensive
investigation of the cliff dwellings it is evident that the inhabitants
had the same material culture as that of existing
Pueblo Indians, and from the ceremonial objects which have
been discovered and the symbolic decoration that was employed
it is equally clear that their religion was essentially
similar. Moreover the various types of skulls that have been
recovered are similar to those of the present population of the
district. It may therefore be safely said that there is no evidence
of the former general occupancy of the region by peoples
other than those now classed as Pueblo Indians or their
neighbours.</p>

<p>J. W. Fewkes points out that the district is one of arid
plateaus, separated and dissected by deep ca&ntilde;ons, frequently
composed of flat-lying rock strata forming ledge-marked cliffs
by the erosive action of the rare storms. "Only along the few
streams heading in the mountains does permanent water exist,
and along the cliff lines slabs of rock suitable for building
abound; and the primitive ancients, dependent as they were
on environment, naturally produced the cliff dwellings. The
tendency toward this type was strengthened by intertribal
relations; the cliff dwellers were probably descended from
agricultural or semi-agricultural villagers who sought protection
against enemies, and the control of land and water through
aggregation in communities.... Locally the ancient villages of
Canyon de Chelly are known as Aztec ruins, and this designation
is just so far as it implies relationship with the aborigines of
moderately advanced culture in Mexico and Central America,
though it would be misleading if regarded as indicating essential
difference between the ancient villagers and their modern descendants
and neighbours still occupying the pueblos<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion.</div>

<p>Each pueblo contains at least one <i>kiva</i>, either wholly or
partly underground, entered by means of a ladder and hatchway,
forming a sacred chamber for the transaction of civil or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>religious affairs, and also a club for the men. In some villages
each totemic clan has its own <i>kiva</i>.  The Indians
are eminently a religious people and much time
is devoted to complicated rites to ensure a supply of rain, their
main concern, and the growth of crops. Among the Hopi
from four to sixteen days in every month are employed by one
society or another in the carrying out of religious rites. The
secret portions of these complicated ceremonies take place in
the <i>kiva</i>, while the so-called "dances" are performed in the
open.</p>

<p>The clan ancestors may be impersonated by masked men,
called <i>katcinas</i>, the name being also applied to the religious
dramas in which they appear<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Snake Dances.</div>

<p>In reference to J. Walter Fewkes' account of the "Tusayan
Snake Ceremonies," it is pointed out that "the Pueblo Indians
adore a plurality of deities, to which various potencies
are ascribed. These zoic deities, or beast
gods, are worshipped by means of ceremonies which are sometimes
highly elaborate; and, so far as practicable, the mystic
zoic potency is represented in the ceremony by a living animal
of similar species or by an artificial symbol. Prominent among
the animate representatives of the zoic pantheon throughout
the arid region is the serpent, especially the venomous and
hence mysteriously potent rattlesnake. To the primitive mind
there is intimate association, too, between the swift-striking
and deadly viper and the lightning, with its attendant rain and
thunder; there is intimate association, too, between the moisture-loving
reptile of the subdeserts and the life-giving storms and
freshets; and so the native rattlesnake plays an important
r&ocirc;le in the ceremonies, especially in the invocations for rain,
which characterize the entire arid region<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span></p>

<p>Fewkes pursues the same fruitful line of thought in his
monograph on <i>The Feather Symbol in Ancient Hopi Designs</i><a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a>,
showing how amongst the Tusayan Pueblos, although they
have left no written records, there survives an elaborate
paleography, the feather <i>motif</i> in the pottery found in the old
ruins, which is in fact "a picture writing often highly symbolic
and complicated," revealing certain phases of Hopi thought
in remote times. "Thus we come back to a belief, taught by
other reasoning, that ornamentation of ancient pottery was
something higher than simple effort to beautify ceramic wares.
The ruling motive was a religious one, for in their system
everything was under the same sway. Esthetic and religious
feelings were not differentiated, the one implied the other, and
to elaborately decorate a vessel without introducing a religious
symbol was to the ancient potter an impossibility<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physical Type.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Social Life.</div>

<p>Physically the Pueblo Indians are of short stature, with
long, low head, delicate face and dark skin. They are muscular
and of great endurance, able to carry heavy
burdens up steep and difficult trails, and to walk
or even run great distances. It is said to be no uncommon
thing for a Hopi to run 40 miles over a burning desert
to his cornfield, hoe his corn, and return home within
24 hours. Distances of 140 miles are frequently made
within 36 hours<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a>. In disposition they are mild and peaceable,
industrious, and extraordinarily conservative, a trait shown in
the fidelity with which they retain and perpetuate their ancient
customs<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a>. Labour is more evenly divided than among most
Indian tribes. The men help the women with
the heavier work of house-building, they collect
the fuel, weave blankets and make moccasins, occupations
usually regarded as women's work. The women carry the
water, and make the pottery for which the region is famous<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a>.</p>

<p>A. L. Kroeber has made a careful study of Zu&ntilde;i sociology<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a>
and come to the conclusion that the family is fundamental
and the clan secondary, though kinship terms are applied to
clan mates in a random fashion, and even the true kinship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
terms are applied loosely. In view of the obvious pre&euml;minence
of the woman, who receives the husband into her and her
mother's house, it is worthy of note that she and her children
recognise her husband's relatives as their kin as fully as he
adopts hers. The Zu&ntilde;i are not a woman-ruled people. As
regards government, women neither claim nor have any voice
whatever, nor are there women priests, nor fraternity officers.
Even within the house, so long as a man is a legitimate
inmate thereof, he is master of it and of its affairs. They
are a monogamous people. Divorce is more easy than
marriage, and most men and women of middle age have been
married to several partners. Marriage in the mother's clan
is forbidden; in the father's clan, disapproved. The phratries
have no social significance, there is no central clan house, no
recognised head, no meeting, council or any organisation, nor
does the clan as such ever act as a body. The clans have
little connection with the religious societies or fraternities.
There are no totemic tabus nor is there worship of the clan
totem. People are reckoned as belonging to the father's clan
almost as much as to that of the mother. If one of the family
of a person who belongs to a fraternity falls sick the fraternity
is called in to cure the patient, who is subsequently received
into its ranks. The Zu&ntilde;i fraternity is largely a body of
religious physicians, membership is voluntary and not limited
by sex. At Hopi we hear of rain-making more than of
doctoring, more of "priests" than of "theurgists." The
religious functions of the Zu&ntilde;i are most marked in the ceremonies
of the Ko-tikkyanne, the "god-society" or "masked-dancer
society," and it is with these that the <i>kivas</i> are
associated. They are almost wholly concerned with rain.
Only men can become members and entrance is compulsory.
Kroeber believes that "the truest understanding of Zu&ntilde;i life,
other than its purely practical manifestation, can be had by
setting the ettowe ['fetish'] as a centre. Around these,
priesthoods, fraternities, clan organisation, as well as most
esoteric thinking and sacred tradition, group themselves;
while, in turn, kivas, dances, and acts of public worship can
be construed as but the outward means of expression of the
inner activities that radiate around the nucleus of the physical
fetishes and the ideas attached to them<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a>."</p>

of which J. Numa Rat contributed a somewhat full account to the <i>Journ. Anthr.
Inst.</i> for Nov. 1897, p. 293 sq. Here the broken form <i>arametakuah&aacute;tina buka</i>
appears to represent the polysynthetic <i>arametakuanientibubuka</i> (root <i>arameta</i>, to
hide), as in P&egrave;re Breton's <i>Grammaire Caraibe</i>, p. 45, where we have also the form
<i>arametakualubatibubasubutuiruni</i> = know that he will conceal thee (p. 48). It
may at the same time be allowed that great inroads have been made on the principle
of polysynthesis even in the continental (South American) Carib, as well as
in the Colombian Chibcha, the Mexican Otomi and Pima, and no doubt in some
other linguistic groups. But that the system must have formerly been continuous
over the whole of America seems proved by the persistence of extremely polysynthetic
tongues in such widely separated regions as Greenland (Eskimo),
Mexico (Aztec), Peru (Quichuan), and Chili (Araucanian).</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Mexican
and Central
American
Cultures.</div>

<p>In Mexico and Central America interest is centred chiefly
in two great ethnical groups&mdash;the <i>Nahuatlan</i> and <i>Huaxtecan</i>&mdash;whose
cultural, historical, and even geographical
relations are so intimately interwoven that
they can scarcely be treated apart. Thus, although
their civilisations are concentrated respectively
in the Anahuac (Mexican) plateau and Yucatan and Guatemala,
the two domains overlap completely at both ends, so that there
are isolated branches of the Huaxtecan family in Mexico (the
Huaxtecs (Totonacs) of Vera Cruz, from whom the whole
group is named, and of the Nahuatlan in Nicaragua (Pipils,
Niquirans, and others)<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a>.</p>

<p>This very circumstance has no doubt tended to increase
the difficulties connected with the questions of their origins,
migrations, and mutual cultural influences. Some of these
difficulties disappear if the "Toltecs" be eliminated (see p. 342),
who had hitherto been a great disturbing element in this connection,
and all the rest have in my opinion been satisfactorily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
disposed of by E. F&ouml;rstemann, a leading authority on all
Aztec-Maya questions<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a>. This eminent archaeologist refers first
to the views of Seler<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a>, who assumes a southern movement of
Maya tribes from Yucatan, and a like movement of Aztecs
from Tabasco to Nicaragua, and even to Yucatan. On the
other hand Dieseldorff holds that Maya art was independently
developed, while the link between it and the Aztec shows that
an interchange took place, in which process the Maya was the
giver, the Aztec the recipient. He further attributes the overthrow
of the Maya power 100 or 200 years before the conquest
to the Aztecs, and thinks the Aztecs or Nahuas took their god
Quetzalcoatl from the "Toltecs," who were a Maya people.
Ph. J. Valentini also infers that the Maya were the original
people, the Aztecs "mere parasites<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a>."</p>

<p>Now F&ouml;rstemann lays down the principle that any theory,
to be satisfactory, should fit in with such facts as:&mdash;(1) the
agreement and diversity of both cultures; (2) the antiquity
and disappearance of the mysterious Toltecs; (3) the complete
isolation at 22&deg; N. lat. of the Huaxtecs from the other Maya
tribes, and their difference from them; (4) the equally complete
isolation of the Guatemalan Pipils, and of the other southern
(Nicaraguan) Aztec groups from the rest of the Nahua peoples;
(5) the remarkable absence of Aztec local names in Yucatan,
while they occur in hundreds in Chiapas, Guatemala, Honduras
and Nicaragua, where scarcely any trace is left of Maya names.</p>

<p>To account for these facts he assumes that in the earliest
known times Central America from about 23&deg; to 10&deg; N. was
mainly inhabited by Maya tribes, who had even reached Cuba.
While these Mayas were still at quite a low stage of culture,
the Aztecs advanced from as far north as at least 26&deg; N. but
only on the Pacific side, thus leaving the Huaxtecs almost
untouched in the east. The Aztecs called the Mayas "Toltecs"
because they first came in contact with one of their northern
branches living in the region about Tula (north of Mexico
city)<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a>. But when all the relations became clearer, the Toltecs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
fell gradually into the background, and at last entered the
domain of the fabulous.</p>

<p>Now the Aztecs borrowed much from the Mayas, especially
gods, whose names they simply translated. A typical case is
that of Cuculcan, which becomes Quetzalcoatl, where <i>cuc</i> = <i>quezal</i>
= the bird <i>Trogon resplendens</i>, and <i>can</i> = <i>coatl</i> = snake<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a>. With
the higher culture developed in Guatemala the Aztecs came
first in contact after passing through Mixtec and Zapotec
territory, not long before Columbian times, so that they had
no time here to consolidate their empire and assimilate the
Mayas. On the contrary the Aztecs were themselves merged
in these, all but the Pipils and the settlements on Lake Nicaragua,
which retained their national peculiarities.</p>

<p>But whence came the hundreds of Aztec names in the lands
between Chiapas and Nicaragua? Here it should be noted
that these names are almost exclusively confined to the more
important stations, while the less prominent places have everywhere
names taken from the tongues of the local tribes. But
even the Aztec names themselves occur properly only in official
use, hence also on the charts, and are not current to-day
amongst the natives who have kept aloof from the Spanish-speaking
populations. Hence the inference that such names
were mainly introduced by the Spaniards and their Mexican
troops during the conquest of those lands, say, up to about
1535, and do not appear in Yucatan which was not conquered
from Mexico. F&ouml;rstemann reluctantly accepts this view, advanced
by Sapper<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a>, having nothing better to suggest.</p>

<p>The coastal towns of Yucatan visited by Spaniards from
Cuba in 1517 and onwards were decidedly inferior architecturally
to the great temple structures of the interior, though
doubtless erected by the same people. The inland cities of
Chichen-Itza and Uxmal by that time had fallen from their
ancient glory though still religious centres<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aztec and
Maya Scripts</div>

<p>The Maya would thus appear to have stood on a higher
plane of culture than their Aztec rivals, and the same conclusion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>may be drawn from their respective writing systems. Of all
the aborigines these two alone had developed what may fairly
be called a script in the strict sense of the term, although
neither of them had reached the same level of efficiency as
the Babylonian cuneiforms, or the Chinese or the Egyptian
hieroglyphs, not to speak of the syllabic and alphabetic systems
of the Old World. Some even of the barbaric peoples, such
as most of the prairie Indians, had reached the stage of graphic
symbolism, and were thus on the threshold of writing at the
discovery. "The art was rudimentary and limited to crude
pictography. The pictographs were painted or sculptured on
cliff-faces, boulders, the walls of caverns, and even on trees,
as well as on skins, bark, and various artificial objects. Among
certain Mexican tribes, also, autographic records were in use,
and some of them were much better differentiated
than any within the present area of the United
States. The records were not only painted and
sculptured on stone and moulded in stucco, but were inscribed
in books or codices of native parchment and paper; while the
characters were measurably arbitrary, <i>i.e.</i> ideographic rather
than pictographic<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a>."</p>

<p>The Aztec writing may be best described as pictographic,
the pictures being symbolical or, in the case of names, combined
into a rebus. No doubt much diversity of opinion prevails as
to whether the Maya symbols are phonetic or ideographic,
and it is a fact that no single text, however short, has yet
been satisfactorily deciphered. It seems that many of the
symbols possessed true phonetic value and were used to express
sounds and syllables, though it cannot be claimed that
the Maya scribes had reached that advanced stage where they
could indicate each letter sound by a glyph or symbol<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a>. According
to Cyrus Thomas, a symbol was selected because the
name or word it represented had as its chief phonetic element
a certain consonant sound or syllable. If this were <i>b</i> the symbol
would be used where <i>b</i> was the prominent element of the word<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
to be indicated, no reference, however, to its original signification
being necessarily retained. Thus the symbol for <i>cab</i>,
'earth,' might be used in writing <i>Caban</i>, a day name, or <i>cabil</i>,
'honey,' because <i>cab</i> is their chief phonetic element.... One
reason why attempts at decipherment have failed is a misconception
of the peculiar character of the writing, which is
in a transition stage from the purely ideographic to the
phonetic<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a>. From the example here given, the Maya script
would appear to have in part reached the rebus stage, which
also plays so large a part in the Egyptian hieroglyphic system.
<i>Cab</i> is obviously a rebus, and the transition from the rebus to
true syllabic and alphabetic systems has already been explained<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a>.
The German Americanists on the other hand have always
regarded Maya writing as more ideographic, and H. Beuchat
adopts this view, for "no symbol has ever been read phonetically
with a different meaning from that which it possesses
as an ideogram<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">and Calendars.</div>

<p>But not only were the Maya day characters phonetic; the
Maya calendar itself, afterwards borrowed by the Aztecs, has
been described as even more accurate than the
Julian itself. "Among the Plains Indians the
calendars are simple, consisting commonly of a record of
winters ('winter counts'), and of notable events occurring
either during the winter or during some other season; while
the shorter time divisions are reckoned by 'nights' (days),
'dead moons' (lunations), and seasons of leafing, flowering,
or fruiting of plants, migrating of animals, etc., and there is
no definite system of reducing days to lunations or lunations
to years. Among the Pueblo Indians calendric records are
inconspicuous or absent, though there is a much more definite
calendric system which is fixed and perpetuated by religious
ceremonies; while among some of the Mexican tribes there
are elaborate calendric systems combined with complete
calendric records. The perfection of the calendar among
the Maya and Nahua Indians is indicated by the fact that
not only were 365 days reckoned as a year, but the bissextile
was recognized<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Nahua and
Shoshoni.</div>

<p>In another important respect the superiority of the Maya-Quich&eacute;
peoples over the northern Nahuans is incontestable.
When their religious systems are compared, it is
at once seen that at the time of the discovery
the Mexican Aztecs were little better than ruthless
barbarians newly clothed in the borrowed robes of an
advanced culture, to which they had not had time to adapt
themselves properly, and in which they could but masquerade
after their own savage fashion.</p>

<p>It has to be remembered that the Aztecs were but one
branch of the Nahuatlan family, whose affinities Buschmann<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a>
has traced northwards to the rude Shoshonian aborigines who
roamed from the present States of Montana, Idaho, and Oregon
down into Utah, Texas, and California<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a>. To this Nahuatlan
stock belonged the barbaric hordes who overthrew the civilisation
which flourished on the Anahuac (Mexican) table-land
about the sixth century <small>A.D.</small> and is associated with the ruins
of Tula and Cholula. It now seems clear that the so-called
"Toltecs," the "Pyramid-builders," were not Nahuatlans but
Huaxtecans, who were absorbed by the immigrants or driven
southwards.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Chichimec and
Aztec Empires.</div>

<p>To north and north-west of the settled peoples of the
valley lived nomadic hunting tribes called Chichimec<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a>, merged
in a loose political system which was dignified in
the local traditions by the name of the "Chichimec
Empire." The chief part was played by tribes
of Nahuan origin<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a>, whose ascendancy lasted from about the
eleventh to the fifteenth century, when they were in their turn
overthrown and absorbed by the historical Nahuan confederacy
of the <i>Aztecs</i><a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> whose capital was Tenochtitlan (the present city
of Mexico), the <i>Acolhuas</i> (capital Tezcuco), and the <i>Tepanecs</i>
(capital Tlacopan).</p>

<p>Thus the Aztec Empire reduced by the Conquistadores in
1520 had but a brief record, although the Aztecs themselves
as well as many other tribes of Nahuatl speech, must have
been in contact with the more civilised Huaxtecan peoples for
centuries before the appearance of the Spaniards on the scene.
It was during these ages that the Nahuas "borrowed much
from the Mayas," as F&ouml;rstemann puts it, without greatly
benefiting by the process. Thus the Maya gods, for the most
part of a relatively mild type like the Maya themselves, become
in the hideous Aztec pantheon ferocious demons with an
insatiable thirst for blood, so that the teocalli, "god's houses,"
were transformed to human shambles, where on solemn
occasions the victims were said to have numbered tens of
thousands<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Uncultured
Mexican
Peoples.</div>

<p>Besides the Aztecs and their allies, the elevated Mexican
plateaus were occupied by several other relatively civilised
nations, such as the <i>Miztecs</i> and <i>Zapotecs</i> of
Oajaca, the <i>Tarasco</i> and neighbouring <i>Matlaltzinca</i>,
of Michoacan<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a>, all of whom spoke independent
stock languages, and the <i>Totonacs</i> of Vera Cruz, who
were of Huaxtecan speech, and were in touch to the north
with the Huaxtecs, a primitive Maya people. The high degree
of civilisation attained by some of these nations before their
reduction by the Aztecs is attested by the magnificent ruins
of Mitla, capital of the Zapotecs, which was captured and
destroyed by the Mexicans in 1494<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a>. Of the royal palace
Viollet-le-Duc speaks in enthusiastic terms, declaring that
"the monuments of the golden age of Greece and Rome
alone equal the beauty of the masonry of this great building<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a>."
In general their usages and religious rites resembled those of
the Aztecs, although the Zapotecs, besides the civil ruler, had
a High Priest who took part in the government. "His feet
were never allowed to touch the ground; he was carried on
the shoulders of his attendants; and when he appeared all,
even the chiefs themselves, had to fall prostrate before him,
and none dared to raise their eyes in his presence<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a>." The
Zapotec language is still spoken by about 260 natives in the
State of Oajaca.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Otomi&mdash;Seri.</div>

<p>Farther north the plains and uplands continued to be
inhabited by a multitude of wild tribes speaking an unknown
number of stock languages, and thus presenting a chaos of
ethnical and linguistic elements comparable to that which
prevails along the north-west coast. Of these rude populations
one of the most widespread are the Otomi
of the central region, noted for the monosyllabic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
tendencies of their language, which Najera, a native grammarian,
has on this ground compared with Chinese, from
which, however, it is fundamentally distinct. Still more
primitive are the Seri Indians of Tiburon island in the Gulf
of California and the adjacent mainland, who were visited in
1895 by W. J. McGee, and found to be probably more isolated
and savage than any other tribe remaining on the North
American Continent. They hunt, fish, and collect vegetable
food, and most of their food is eaten raw, they have no
domestic animals save dogs, they are totally without agriculture,
and their industrial arts are few and rude. They use
the bow and arrow but have no knife. Their houses are
flimsy huts. They make pottery and rafts of canes. The
Seri are loosely organised in a number of exogamic, matrilineal,
totemic clans. Mother-right obtains to a greater extent
perhaps than in any other people. At marriage the husband
becomes a privileged guest in the wife's mother's household,
and it is only in the chase or on the war-path that men take
an important place. Polygyny prevails. The most conspicuous
ceremony is the girls' puberty feast. The dead are buried in
a contracted position. "The strongest tribal characteristic is
implacable animosity towards aliens.... In their estimation the
brightest virtue is the shedding of alien blood, while the
blackest crime in their calendar is alien conjugal union<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early Man in
Yucatan.</div>

<p>It is noteworthy that but few traces of such savagery have
yet been discovered in Yucatan. The investigations of Henry
Mercer<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> in this region lend strong support to F&ouml;rstemann's
views regarding the early Huaxtecan migrations and the
general southward spread of Maya culture from the Mexican
table-land. Nearly thirty caves examined by this
explorer failed to yield any remains either of the
mastodon, mammoth, and horse, or of early man,
elsewhere so often associated with these animals. Hence
Mercer infers that the Mayas reached Yucatan already in an
advanced state of culture, which remained unchanged till the
conquest. In the caves were found great quantities of good
pottery, generally well baked and of symmetrical form, the
oldest quite as good as the latest where they occur in stratified
beds, showing no progress anywhere.</p>

<p>The caves of Loltun (Yucatan) and Copan (Honduras),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
examined by E. H. Thompson and G. Byron-Gordon, yielded
pre-Mayan d&eacute;bris from the deep strata. Perhaps this very
ancient population was of the same race as the little known
tribes still living in the forests of Honduras and San Salvador<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Maya
to-day.</div>

<p>Since the conquest the Aztecs, and other cultured nations
of Anahuac, have yielded to European influences to a far
greater extent than the Maya-Quich&eacute; of Yucatan and Guatemala.
In the city of Mexico the Nahuatl tongue has almost
died out, and this place has long been a leading centre of
Spanish arts and letters<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a>; yet the Mexicans yearly celebrate
a feast in memory of their great ancestors who died in defence
of their country<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a>. But Merida, standing on the site of the
ancient Ti-ho&oacute;, has almost again become a Maya town, where
the white settlers themselves have been largely assimilated in
speech and usages to the natives. The very streets are still
indicated by the carved images of the hawk,
flamingo, or other tutelar deities, while the houses
of the suburbs continue to be built in the old
Maya style, two or three feet above the street level, with
a walled porch and stone bench running round the enclosure.</p>

<p>One reason for this remarkable contrast may be that the
Nahua culture, as above seen, was to a great extent borrowed
in relatively recent times, whereas the Maya civilisation is now
shown to date from the epoch of the Tolan and Cholulan
pyramid-builders. Hence the former yielded to the first shock,
while the latter still persists to some extent in Yucatan. Here
about 1000 <small>A.D.</small> the cities of Chichen-Itza, Uxmal and Mayapan
formed a confederacy in which each was to share equally in
the government of the country. Under the peaceful conditions
of the next two centuries followed the second and last great
Maya epoch, the Age of Architecture, as it has been termed,
as opposed to the first epoch, the Age of Sculpture, from the
second to the sixth century <small>A.D.</small> During this earlier epoch
flourished the great cities of the south, Palenque, Quirigua,
Copan, and others<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a>. Despite their more gentle disposition,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
as expressed in the softer and almost feminine lines of their
features, the Mayas held out more valiantly than the Aztecs
against the Spaniards, and a section of the nation occupying
a strip of territory between Yucatan and British Honduras,
still maintains its independence. The "barbarians," as the
inhabitants of this district are called, would appear to be
scarcely less civilised than their neighbours, although they
have forgotten the teachings of the padres, and transformed
the Catholic churches to wayside inns. Even as it is the
descendants of the Spaniards have to a great extent forgotten
their mother-tongue, and Maya-Quich&eacute; dialects are almost
everywhere current except in the Campeachy district. Those
also who call themselves Catholics preserve and practise many
of the old rites. After burial the track from the grave to the
house is carefully chalked, so that the soul of the departed
may know the way back when the time comes to enter the
body of some new-born babe. The descendants of the national
astrologers everywhere pursue their arts, determining events,
forecasting the harvests and so on by the conjunctions of the
stars, and every village has its native "Zadkiel" who reads
the future in the ubiquitous crystal globe. Even certain priests
continue to celebrate the "Field Mass," at which a cock is
sacrificed to the Mayan Aesculapius, with invocations to the
Trinity and their associates, the four genii of the rain and
crops. "These tutelar deities, however, have taken Christian
names, the Red, or God of the East, having become St
Dominic; the White, or God of the North, St Gabriel; the
Black, or God of the West, St James; and the 'Yellow
Goddess' of the South, Mary Magdalene<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transitions
from North to
South America.</div>

<p>To the observer passing from the northern to the southern
division of the New World no marked contrasts are at first
perceptible, either in the physical appearance,
or in the social condition of the aborigines. The
substantial uniformity, which in these respects
prevails from the Arctic to the Austral waters, is in fact
well illustrated by the comparatively slight differences presented
by the primitive populations dwelling north and south
of the Isthmus of Panama.</p>

<p>At the discovery the West Indies were inhabited by two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
distinct peoples, both apparently of South American origin.
The populations of the Greater Antilles, Cuba, Jamaica, Santo
Domingo and Porto Rico were of Arawak stock, as were also
the Lucayans of the Bahamas. The Lesser Antilles were
peopled by Caribs, whose culture had been somewhat modified
by the Arawaks who had preceded them. As regards influences
from the north-west and west, Joyce considers that
intercourse between Yucatan and Western Cuba was confined
to occasional trading voyages and did not long antedate
the arrival of the Spaniards. The same applies to Florida
where, however, Antillean influences may be traced, especially
in pottery designs<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a>. According to Beuchat, however, the
Guacanabibes of Cuba are of common origin with the Tekestas
of Florida. Other tribes from Florida spread to the Bahamas,
Cuba<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a>, and perhaps Hayti, but were checked by Arawaks from
South America who mastered the whole of the West Indies.
Last came the more vigorous but less advanced Caribs, also
from the southern mainland (of Arawak origin according to
Joyce and Beuchat). The statement of Columbus that the
Lucayans<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> were "of good size, with large eyes and broader
foreheads than he had ever seen in any other race of men" is
fully borne out by the character of some old skulls from the
Bahamas measured by W. K. Brooks, who regarded them as
belonging to "a well-marked type of the North American
Indian race which was at that time distributed over the
Bahama Islands, Hayti, and the greater part of Cuba. As
these islands are only a few miles from the peninsula of
Florida, this race must at some time have inhabited at least
the south-eastern extremity of the continent, and it is therefore
extremely interesting to note that the North American
crania which exhibit the closest resemblance to those from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
the Bahama Islands have been obtained from Florida<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a>."
This observer dwells on the solidity and massiveness of the
Lucayan skulls, which bring them into direct relation with
the races both of the Mississippi plains and of the Brazilian
and Venezuelan coast-lands, though the general ethnography
of Panama and Costa Rica reveals no active influence exerted
by tribes of Colombia and Venezuela, except in eastern
Panama<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chontal and
Choco.</div>

<p>Equally close is the connection established between the
surviving Isthmian and Colombian peoples of the Atrato and
Magdalena basins. The Chontal of Nicaragua
are scarcely to be distinguished from some of
the Santa Marta hillmen, while the Choco and
perhaps the Cuna of Panama have been affiliated to the
Choco of the Atrato and San Juan rivers. The cultural
connection between the tribes of the Isthmus and of Colombia
appears especially in the gold-work and pottery of the Chiriqui;
at the Chiriqui Lagoon, however, Nahuan influence
is perceptible<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a>. Attempts, which however can hardly be
regarded as successful, have even been made to establish
linguistic relations between the Costa Rican Guatuso and
the Timote of the Merida uplands of Venezuela, who are
themselves a branch of the formerly widespread Muyscan
family.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Catio.</div>

<p>But with these Muyscans we at once enter a new ethnical
and cultural domain, in which may be studied the resemblances
due to the common origin of all the American aborigines,
and the divergences due obviously to long isolation and independent
local developments in the two continental divisions.
In general the southern populations present more violent
contrasts than the northern in their social and intellectual
developments, so that while the wild tribes touch a lower
depth of savagery, some at least of the civilised peoples rise
to a higher degree of excellence, if not in letters&mdash;where the
inferiority is manifest&mdash;certainly in the arts of engineering,
architecture, agriculture, and political organisation. Thus we
need not travel many miles inland from the Isthmus without
meeting the Catio, a wild tribe between the Atrato and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>Cauca, more degraded even than the Seri of Tiburon island,
most debased of all North American hordes.
These Catio, a now nearly extinct branch of the
Choco stock, were said to dwell like the anthropoid apes, in
the branches of trees; they mostly went naked, and were
reported, like the Mangbattus and other Congo negroes, to
"fatten their captives for the table." Their Darien neighbours
of the Nore valley, who gave an alternative name to
the Panama peninsula, were accustomed to steal the women
of hostile tribes, cohabit with them, and carefully bring up
the children till their fourteenth year, when they were eaten
with much rejoicing, the mothers ultimately sharing the same
fate<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a>; and the Cocoma of the Mara&ntilde;on "were in the habit
of eating their own dead relations, and grinding their bones
to drink in their fermented liquor. They said it was better
to be inside a friend than to be swallowed up by the cold
earth<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a>." In fact of the Colombian aborigines Herrera tells us
that "the living are the grave of the dead; for the husband
has been seen to eat his wife, the brother his brother or sister,
the son his father; captives also are eaten roasted<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a>."</p>

<p>Thus is raised the question of cannibalism in the New
World, where at the discovery it was incomparably more
prevalent south than north of the equator. Compare the
Eskimo and the Fuegians at the two extremes, the former
practically exonerated of the charge, and in distress sparing
wives and children and eating their dogs; the latter sparing
their dogs because useful for catching otters, and smoking
and eating their old women because useless for further purposes<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a>.
In the north the taste for human flesh had declined,
and the practice survived only as a ceremonial rite, chiefly
amongst the British Columbians and the Aztecs, except of
course in case of famine, when even the highest races are
capable of devouring their fellows. But in the south cannibalism
in some of its most repulsive forms was common enough
almost everywhere.  Killing and eating feeble and aged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
members of the tribe in kindness is still general; but the
Mayorunas of the Upper Amazon waters do not wait till they
have grown lean with years or wasted with disease<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a>; and it
was a baptized member of the same tribe who complained on
his death-bed that he would not now provide a meal for his
Christian friends, but must be devoured by worms<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cultures of the
Andean Area.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Chibcha.</div>

<p>In the southern continent the social conditions illustrated
by these practices prevailed everywhere, except on the
elevated plateaus of the western Cordilleras,
which for many ages before the discovery had
been the seats of several successive cultures, in
some respects rivalling, but in others much inferior to those
of Central America. When the Conquistadores reached this
part of the New World, to which they were attracted by the
not altogether groundless reports of fabulous wealth embodied
in the legend of <i>El Dorado</i>, the "Man of Gold," they found
it occupied by a cultural zone which extended almost continuously
from the present republic of Colombia through
Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia right into Chili. In
the north the dominant people were the semi-civilised
Chibcha, already mentioned under the name of
Muysca<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a>, who had developed an organised system of government
on the Bogota table-land, and had succeeded in extending
their somewhat more refined social institutions to some of the
other aborigines of Colombia, though not to many of the outlying
members of their own race. As in Mexico many of the
Nahuatlan tribes remained little better than savages to the
last, so in Colombia the civilised Muyscans were surrounded by
numerous kindred tribes&mdash;Coyaima, Natagaima, Tocaima and
others, collectively known as Panches&mdash;who were real savages
with scarcely any tribal organisation, wearing no clothes, and
according to the early accounts still addicted to cannibalism.</p>

<p>The Muysca proper had a tradition that they owed their
superiority to their culture-hero Bochica, who came from the
east long ago, taught them everything, and was then placed
with Chiminigagua, the creator, at the head of their pantheon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
and worshipped with solemn rites and even human sacrifices.
Amongst the arts thus acquired was that of the goldsmith, in
which they surpassed all other peoples of the New World.
The precious metal was even said to be minted in the shape
of discs, which formed an almost solitary instance of a true
metal currency amongst the American aborigines<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a>. Brooches,
pendants, and especially grotesque figurines of gold, often
alloyed with silver and copper, have been found in great
numbers and still occasionally turn up on the plateau. These
finds are partly accounted for by the practice of offering such
objects in the open air to the personified constellations and
forces of nature, for the primitive religion of all the Andean
tribes consisted of nature-, in particular sun-cults. Near Bogota
was a temple of the Sun, where children were reared for
sacrifice<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a>. Any mysterious sound emanating from a forest,
a rock, a mountain pass, or gloomy gorge, was accepted as
a manifestation of some divine presence; a shrine was raised
to the embodied spirit, and so the whole land became literally
crowded with local deities. This world itself was upborne on
the shoulders of Chibchacum, a national Atlas, who now and
then eased himself by shifting the burden, and thus caused
earthquakes. In most lands subject to underground disturbances
analogous ideas prevail, and when their source is so
obvious, it seems unreasonable to seek for explanations in
racial affinities, contacts, foreign influences, and so forth.</p>

<p>It has often been remarked that at the advent of the whites
the native civilisations seemed generally stricken as if by the
hand of death, so that even if not suddenly arrested by the
intruders they must sooner or later have perished of themselves.
Such speculations are seldom convincing, because we
never know what recuperative forces may be at work to ward
off the evil day. When the Spaniards arrived in Colombia
they found at one end of the scale naked and savage cannibals,
at the other a people with a feudal form of government,
whose political system was progressive, who, though possessing
no form of writing, had a system of measures and a calendar,
and who were skilled in the arts of weaving, pottery, and
metallurgy<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a>. The chiefs of the Chibcha were all absolute
monarchs and the appointment of priests rested with them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
Succession to the chieftainship was matrilineal, and installation
in the office was attended by much ceremony. A great gulf
separated nobles and commoners; slavery existed as an institution
but slaves were well treated. Polygyny was permitted,
but relatives within certain degrees might not marry<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a>. This
feebly organised political system broke to pieces at the first
shock from without, and so disheartened had the people become
under their half theocratic rulers, that they scarcely raised a
hand in defence of a government which in their minds was
associated only with tyranny and oppression. The conquest
was in any case facilitated by the civil war at the time raging
between the northern and southern kingdoms which with
several other semi-independent states constituted the Muyscan
empire. This empire was almost conterminous southwards
with that of the Incas. At least the numerous terms occurring
in the dialects of the Paes, Coconucos, and other South
Colombian tribes, show that Peruvian influences had spread
beyond the political frontiers far to the north, without, however,
quite reaching the confines of the Muyscan domain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Empire of the
Inca.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Quichuan Race
and Speech.</div>

<p>But for several centuries prior to the discovery the sway
of the Peruvian Incas had been established throughout nearly
the whole of the Andean lands, and the territory
directly ruled by them extended from the Quito
district about the equator for some 2500 miles
southwards to the Rio Maule in Chili, with an average breadth
of 400 miles between the Pacific and the eastern slopes of the
Cordilleras. Their dominion thus comprised a considerable
part of the present republics of Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chili,
and Argentina, with a roughly estimated area of 1,000,000
square miles, and a population of over 10,000,000. Here the
ruling race were the Quichua, whose speech,
called by themselves <i>ruma-simi</i>, "the language
of men," is still current in several well-marked
dialects throughout all the provinces of the old empire. In
Lima and all the seaports and inland towns Spanish prevails,
but in the rural districts Quichuan remains the mother-tongue
of over 2,000,000 natives, and has even become the <i>lingua
franca</i> of the western regions, just as Tupi-Guarani is the
<i>lingoa geral</i>, "general language," of the eastern section of
South America. The attempts to find affinities with Aryan
(especially Sanskrit), and other linguistic families of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
eastern hemisphere, have broken down before the application
of sound philological principles to these studies, and
Quichuan is now recognised as a stock language of the usual
American type, unconnected with any other except that of the
Bolivian Aymaras. Even this connection is regarded by some
students as verbal rather than structural, an interchange of a
considerable number of terms being easily explained by the
close contact in which the two peoples have long dwelt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inca Origins
and History.</div>

<p>As to the origin of the Incas we cannot do better than
follow the views of Sir Clements Markham, who has made a
careful study of the various early authorities.
His account (<i>The Incas of Peru,</i> 1910) is
based largely on the works of Spanish military
writers such as Ciezo de Leon and Pedro Pizarro (cousin
of the conqueror), of priests like Molina, Montesinos,
and the half-breed Blas Valera, and on those of the Inca
Garcilasso de la Vega, son of a Spanish knight and an Inca
princess. The megalithic ruins of Tiahuanacu, at the southern
end of Lake Titicaca, mark the earliest known centre of
culture in southern Peru. They are situated on a lofty plateau,
over 13,000 feet above the sea, and are the remains of
a great city built by highly skilled masons who used enormous
stones. The placing of such monoliths, unrivalled except by
those of ancient Egypt, indicates a dense and well-organised
population. The famous monolithic doorway is elaborately
carved, the central figure apparently representing the deity,
while on either side are figures, human- or bird-headed,
kneeling in adoration (<i>op. cit.</i>, pls. at pp. 26, 28). Now it
seems probable that the builders of this megalithic city were
the ancestors of the Incas, assuming that a substratum of
truth underlies the Paccari-tampu myth.</p>

<p>The end of the early civilisation is stated to have been
caused by a great invasion from the south, when the king was
killed in a battle in the Collao, north of Lake Titicaca. A
state of barbarism ensued. A remnant of the royal house took
refuge in a district called Tampu-Tocco ("Window Tavern")<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a>
and there preserved a vestige of their ancient traditions and
civilisation. Elsewhere religion deteriorated to nature worship,
here the kings declared themselves to be children of the sun.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
Montesinos' list of kings gives 27 names for this period of
Tampu-Tocco, which may cover 650 years.</p>

<p>The myth, which is "certainly the outcome of a real
tradition, ... the fabulous version of a distant historical event,"
tells how Manco Ccapac and the three other Ayars, his
brothers, the children of the sun, came forth with their wives
from the central opening or window in the hill Tampu-Tocco.
They advanced slowly at the head of several <i>ayllus</i> (lineages).
Ayar Manco took the lead, and he had with him a falcon-like
bird revered as sacred, and a golden staff which he flung
ahead; when it reached soil so fertile that the whole length
sank in, there the final halt was to be made. This happened
in the fertile vale of Cuzco. The date of these events would
be about four centuries before the Spanish conquest.</p>

<p>Farther north at about 15&deg; S. lat. the Inca civilisation was
preceded, according to Uhle, by the very ancient one of Ica
and Nazca, where dwelt a people who made pottery but were
ignorant of weaving. The same authority has also discovered
about Lima the remains of a tall people, who made rude
pottery, nets, and objects of bone<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Aymara.</div>

<p>Manco established himself in the Cuzco valley, his third
successor finally subjugating the tribes there. The early
position of the Incas, cemented by judicious marriages, seems
to have been one of priority in a very loose confederacy. The
rise of the Incas was due to the ambition of the lady Siuyacu
whose son, Inca Rocca, appears to have been the pioneer of
empire; material prosperity began under him, schools were
erected and irrigation works begun. Then from a strip of
land 250 miles long between the gorge of the Apurimac and
the wide fertile valley of Vilcamayu, the empire was extended
to form the Ttahua-ntin-suyu, "the four provinces," of which
the northern one, Chinchay-suyu, reached to Quito, and the
southern, Colla-suyu, into Chili. This southward extension
was due to the efforts of Pachacuti who succeeded after hard
fighting in annexing the region around Lake Titicaca, and
the new territory was named after the Collas, the largest and
most powerful tribe thereabouts. In order to pacify the region
permanently large numbers of Collas were sent as <i>mitimaes</i>,
or colonists, as far as the borders of Quito, while their places
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>were filled by loyal colonists from Inca districts. Among these
were a number of Aymaras from the Quichuan
region of the Pachachaca, a left bank tributary
of the Apurimac, who were settled among the remaining
Lupacas on the west shore of Lake Titicaca at Juli. Thither
came Jesuit fathers in 1572 and learnt the language of the
Lupacas from these Aymara colonists, who had been there
three generations; the name Aymara was given by the priests
not only to the Lupaca language but to those spoken by Collas
and other Titicacan tribes. Thus the name Aymara is now
generally but quite erroneously applied to the language and
people of this region; it was first so used in 1575. It must
be pointed out, however, that other authorities regard the
Aymara and Quichua as entirely distinct. A. Chervin<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> discusses
the physical differences at great length and concludes
that they are two separate brachycephalic peoples.</p>

<p>The Peruvians were primarily agriculturists, maize and at
higher altitudes the potato being their chief crops. Their
aqueducts and irrigation systems moved the admiration of
early chroniclers, as did also their roads and suspension
bridges<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a>. The supreme deity and creator was Uira-cocha,
who was worshipped by the more intellectual and had a temple
at Cuzco. The popular religion was the worship of the founder
of each <i>ayllu</i>, or clan, and all joined in adoration of the sun as
ancestor of the sovereign Incas. Sun-worship was attended
by a magnificent ritual, the high priest was an official
of highest rank, often a brother of the sovereign, and there
were over 3000 Virgins of the Sun (<i>aclla</i>) connected with the
cult at Cuzco. The peasants put their trust in <i>conopas</i>, or
household gods, which controlled their crops and their llamas.
The calendar had been calculated with considerable ingenuity,
and certain festivals took place annually and were usually
accompanied with much chicha-drinking. It is remarkable
that so advanced a people kept all their elaborate records by
means of <i>quipus</i> (coloured strings with knots).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Chimu.</div>

<p>Here is not the place to enter into the details of the astonishing
architectural, engineering, and artistic remains, often
assigned to the Incas, whose empire had absorbed
in the north the old civilisation of the <i>Chimu</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
perhaps of the <i>Atacame&ntilde;o</i>, and other cultured peoples whose
very names have perished. The Yunga (Mochica or Chimu),
conquered by the Inca Tupac Yupanqui, had a language radically
distinct from Quichuan, but have long been assimilated to their

<p>The ruins of Grand Chimu (modern Trujillo) cover a vast
area, nearly 15 miles by 6, which is everywhere strewn with
the remains of palaces, reservoirs, aqueducts, ramparts, and
especially <i>huacas</i>, that is, truncated pyramids not unlike those
of Mexico, whence the theory that the Chimus, of unknown
origin, were "Toltecs" from Central America. One of these
huacas is described by Squier as 150 feet high with a base
580 feet square, and an area of 8 acres, presenting from a
distance the appearance of a huge crater<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a>. Still larger is the
so-called "Temple of the Sun," 800 by 470 feet, 200 feet high,
and covering an area of 7 acres. An immense population of
hundreds of thousands was assigned to this place in pre-Inca
times; but from some rough surveys made in 1897 it would
appear that much of the space within the enclosures consists
of waste lands, which had never been built over, and it is
calculated that at no time could the number of inhabitants
have greatly exceeded 50,000.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peruvian
Political
System.</div>

<p>We need not stop to describe the peculiar civil and social
institutions of the Peruvians, which are of common knowledge.
Enough to say that here everything was planned
in the interests of the theocratic and all-powerful
Incas, who were more than obeyed, almost
honoured with divine worship by their much bethralled and
priest-ridden subjects. "The despotic authority of the Incas
was the basis of government; that authority was founded on
the religious respect yielded to the descendant of the sun, and
supported by a skilfully combined hierarchy<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a>." From remote
antiquity the peoples of this area were organised into <i>ayllus</i>
each occupying part of a valley or a limited area. It was a
patriarchal system, land belonging to the <i>ayllu</i>, which was
a group of families. The Incas systematised this institution,
the <i>ayllu</i> was made to comprise 100 families under a village
officer who annually allotted land to the heads of families.
Each family was divided by the head into 10 classes based
on age. Ten <i>ayllus</i> (now termed <i>pachacas</i>) formed a <i>huaranca</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
A valley with a varying number of <i>huarancas</i> was termed a
<i>hunu</i>; over four <i>hunus</i> there was an imperial officer. "This
was indeed Socialism," Markham observes, "existing under an
inexorable despotism" (p. 169).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Araucanians.</div>

<p>Beyond the Maule, southernmost limits of all these
effete civilisations, man reasserted himself in the "South
American Iroquois," as those Chilian aborigines
have been called who called themselves <i>Molu-che</i>,
"Warriors," but are better known by their Quichuan designation
of <i>Aucaes</i>, "Rebels," whence the Spanish Aucans (Araucan,
Araucanian). These "Rebels," who have never hitherto been
overcome by the arms of any people, and whose heroic deeds
in the long wars waged by the white intruders against their
freedom form the topic of a noble Spanish epic poem<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a>, still
maintain a measure of national autonomy as the friends and
faithful allies of the Chilian republic. Individual freedom and
equality were leading features of the social system which was
in the main patriarchal. The Araucanians were led by four
independent chiefs, each supported by five <i>ulmen</i>, or district
chiefs, whose office was hereditary but whose authority was
little more than nominal. It was only in time of national
warfare that the tribes united under a war-chief<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a>. Not only
are all the tribes absolutely free, but the same is true of every
clan, sept, and family group. Needless to say, there are no
slaves or serfs. "The law of retaliation was the only one
understood, although the commercial spirit of the Araucano
led him to forego personal revenge for its accruing profit.
Thus every injury had its price<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a>."</p>

<p>The basis of their belief is a rude form of nature worship,
the principal deities being malignant and requiring propitiation.
The chief god was Pillan, the thunder god. Spirits of the
dead go west over the sea to a place of abundance where no
evil spirits have entry<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a>. And this simple belief is almost the
only substitute for the rewards and punishments which supply
the motive for the observance of an artificial ethical code in
so many more developed religious systems.</p>

<p>In the sonorous Araucanian language, which is still spoken
by about 40,000 full-blood natives, the term <i>che</i>, meaning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
"people," occurs as the postfix of several ethnical groups,
which, however, are not tribal but purely territorial divisions.
Thus, while <i>Molu-che</i> is the collective name of the whole
nation, the <i>Picun-che</i>, <i>Huilli-che</i>, and <i>Puel-che</i> are simply the
North, South, and East men respectively. The Central and
most numerous division are the <i>Puen-che</i>, that is, people
of the pine district, who are both the most typical and most
intelligent of all the Araucanian family. Ehrenreich's remark
that many of the American aborigines resemble Europeans as
much as or even more than the Asiatic Mongols, is certainly
borne out by the facial expression of these Puenche. The
resemblance is even extended to the mental characters, as
reflected in their oral literature. Amongst the specimens of
the national folklore preserved in the Puenche dialect and
edited with Spanish translations by Rodolfo Lenz<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a>, is the
story of a departed lover, who returns from the other world
to demand his betrothed and carries her off to his grave.
Although this might seem an adaptation of B&uuml;rger's "Lenore,"
Lenz is of opinion that it is a genuine Araucanian legend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pampas
Indians.</div>

<p>Of the above-mentioned groups the Puelche are now
included politically in Argentina. Their original home seems
to have been north of the Rio Negro, but they
raided westwards and some adopted the Araucanian
language<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> and to them also the Chilian
affix <i>che</i> has also been extended. Indeed the term Puelche,
meaning simply "Easterns," is applied not only to the Argentine
Moluche, whose territory stretches east of the Cordilleras
as far as Mendoza in Cuyo, but also to all the aborigines
commonly called <i>Pampeans</i> (<i>Pampas Indians</i>) by the Europeans
and <i>Penek</i> by the Patagonians. Under the designation
of Puelche would therefore be comprised the now extinct
<i>Ranqualche</i> (Ranqueles), who formerly raided up to Buenos-Ayres
and the other Spanish settlements on the Plate River,
the <i>Mapoche</i> of the Lower Salado, and generally all the
nomads as far south as the Rio Negro.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gauchos.</div>

<p>These aborigines are now best represented by the <i>Gauchos</i>,
who are mostly Spaniards on the father's side and Indians
on the mother's, and reflect this double descent
in their half-nomadic, half-civilised life. These
Gauchos, who are now also disappearing before the encroachments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
of the "Gringos<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a>," <i>i.e.</i> the white immigrants from
almost every country in Europe, have been enveloped in an
ill-deserved halo of romance, thanks mainly to their roving
habits, splendid horsemanship, love of finery, and genial disposition
combined with that innate grace and courtesy which
belongs to all of Spanish blood. But those who knew them
best described them as of sordid nature, cruel to their women-kind,
reckless gamblers and libertines, ruthless political partisans,
at times even religious fanatics without a spark of true
religion, and at heart little better than bloodthirsty savages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Patagonians.</div>

<p>Beyond the Rio Negro follow the gigantic Patagonians,
that is, the <i>Tehuelche</i> or <i>Chuelche</i> of the Araucanians, who
have no true collective name unless it be <i>Tsoneca</i>,
a word of uncertain use and origin. Most of the
tribal groups&mdash;<i>Yacana</i>, <i>Pilma</i>, <i>Chao</i> and others&mdash;are
broken up, and the former division between the Northern
Tehuelche (Tehuelhet), comprising the <i>Callilehet</i> (Serranos or
Highlanders) of the Upper Chupat, with the Calilan between
the Rios Chupat and Negro, and the Southern Tehuelche
(Yacana, Sehuan, etc.), south to Fuegia, no longer holds
good since the general displacement of all these fluctuating
nomad hordes. A branch of the Tehuelche are unquestionably
the <i>Ona</i> of the eastern parts of Fuegia, the true aborigines
of which are the <i>Yahgans</i> of the central and the <i>Alakalufs</i> of
the western islands.</p>

<p>Hitherto to the question whence came these tall Patagonians,
no answer could be given beyond the suggestion
that they may have been specialised in their present habitat,
where nevertheless they seem to be obviously intruders. Now,
however, one may perhaps venture to look for their original
home amongst the <i>Bororo</i> of Matto Grosso, a once powerful
race who held the region between the Rios Cuyaba and
Paraguay. These Bororo, who had been heard of by Martius,
were visited by Ehrenreich<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> and by Karl von den Steinen<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a>,
who found them to be a nomadic hunting people with a
remarkable social organisation centring in the men's club-house
(<i>bait&oacute;</i>). Their physical characters, as described by the
former observer, correspond closely with those of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
Patagonians: "An exceptionally tall race rivalling the South Sea
Islanders, Patagonians, and Redskins; by far the tallest
Indians hitherto discovered within the tropics," their stature
ranging nearly up to 6 ft. 4 in., with very large and rounded
heads (men 81.2; women 77.4). With this should be compared
the very large round old Patagonian skull from the
Rio Negro, measured by Rudolf Martin<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a>. The account reads
like the description of some forerunner of a prehistoric Bororo
irruption into the Patagonian steppe lands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Linguistic
Relations.</div>

<p>To the perplexing use of the term Puelche above referred
to is perhaps due the difference of opinion still prevailing on
the number of stock languages in this southern section of
the Continent. D'Orbigny's emphatic statement<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> that the
Puelche spoke a language fundamentally distinct both from
the Araucanian and the Patagonian has been
questioned on the strength of some Puelche
words, which were collected by Hale at Carmen
on the Rio Negro, and differ but slightly from Patagonian.
But the Rio Negro lies on the ethnical divide between the
two races, which sufficiently accounts for the resemblances,
while the words are too few to prove anything. Hale calls
them "Southern Puelche," but they were in fact Tehuelche
(Patagonian), the true Pampean Puelche having disappeared
from that region before Hale's time<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a>. I have now the unimpeachable
authority of T. P. Schmid, for many years a
missionary amongst these aborigines, for asserting that
d'Orbigny's statement is absolutely correct. His Puelche
were the Pampeans, because he locates them in the region
between the Rios Negro and Colorado, that is, north of
Patagonian and east of Araucanian territory, and Schmid
assures me that all three&mdash;Araucanian, Pampean, and Patagonian&mdash;are
undoubtedly stock languages, distinct both in their
vocabulary and structure, with nothing in common except their
common polysynthetic form. In a list of 2000 Patagonian
and Araucanian words he found only two alike, <i>patac</i> = 100,
and <i>huarunc</i> = 1000, numerals obviously borrowed by the rude<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
Tehuelche from the more cultured Moluche. In Fuegia
there is at least one radically distinct tongue, the Yahgan,
studied by Bridges. Here the Ona is probably a Patagonian
dialect, and Alakaluf perhaps remotely allied to Araucanian.
Thus in the whole region south of the Plate River the stock
languages are not known to exceed four: Araucanian; Pampean
(Puelche); Patagonian (Tehuelche); and Yahgan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Yahgans.</div>

<p>Few aboriginal peoples have been the subject of more
glaringly discrepant statements than the Yahgans, to whom
several lengthy monographs have been devoted
during the last few decades. How contradictory
are the statements of intelligent and even trained observers,
whose good faith is beyond suspicion and who have no cause
to serve except the truth, will best be seen by placing in
juxtaposition the accounts of the family relations by G. Bove,
a well-known Italian observer, and P. Hyades of the French
Cape Horn Expedition, both summarised<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<h4><i>Bove.</i></h4>

<div class="pblockquot"><p>The women are treated as slaves.
The greater the number of wives or
slaves a man has the easier he finds a
living; hence polygamy is deep-rooted
and four wives common. Owing to
rigid climate and bad treatment the
mortality of children under 10 years is
excessive; the mother's love lasts till
the child is weaned, after which it rapidly
wanes, and is completely gone when the
child attains the age of 7 or 8 years.
The Fuegian's only lasting love is the
love of self. As there are no family
ties, the word "authority" is devoid of
meaning.</p></div>

<h4><i>Hyades.</i></h4>

<div class="pblockquot"><p>The Fuegians are capable of great
love which accounts for the jealousy
of the men over their wives and the
coquetry sometimes manifested by
the women and girls.</p>

<p>Some men have two or more wives,
but monogamy is the rule.</p>

<p>Children are tenderly cared for by
their parents, who in return are treated
by them with affection and deference.</p>

<p>The Fuegians are of a generous disposition
and like to share their pleasures
with others. The husbands exercise due
control, and punish severely any act of
infidelity.</p></div>

<p>These seeming contradictions may be partly explained by
the general improvement in manners due to the beneficent
action of the English missionaries in recent years, and great
progress has certainly been made since the accounts of King,
Fitz-Roy and Darwin<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Cashibo.</div>

<p>But even in the more favoured regions of the Parana and
Amazon basins many tribes are met which yield little if at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>all to the Fuegians of the early writers in sheer savagery and
debasement. Thus the <i>Cashibo</i> or <i>Carapache</i>
of the Ucayali, who are described as "white
as Germans, with long beards<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a>," may be said to answer almost
better than any other human group to the old saying, <i>homo
homini lupus</i>. They roam the forests like wild beasts, living
almost entirely upon game, in which is included man himself.
"When one of them is pursuing the chase in the woods and
hears another hunter imitating the cry of an animal, he immediately
makes the same cry to entice him nearer, and, if
he is of another tribe, he kills him if he can, and (as is alleged)
eats him." Hence they are naturally "in a state of hostility
with all their neighbours<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pano
Family.</div>

<p>These Cashibo, <i>i.e.</i> "Bats," are members of a widespread
linguistic family which in ethnological writings bears the name
of <i>Pano</i>, from the Pano of the Huallaga and
Mara&ntilde;on, who are now broken up or greatly
reduced, but whose language is current amongst
the Cashibo, the Conibo, the Karipuna, the Setebo, the
Sipivio (Shipibo) and others about the head waters of the
Amazons in Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil, as far east as the
Madeira. Amongst these, as amongst the Moxo and so
many other riverine tribes in Amazonia, a slow transformation
is in progress. Some have been baptized, and while still
occupying their old haunts and keeping up the tribal organisation,
have been induced to forego their savage ways and
turn to peaceful pursuits. They are beginning to wear clothes,
usually cotton robes of some vivid colour, to till the soil, take
service with the white traders, or even trade themselves in
their canoes up and down the tributaries of the Amazons.
Beyond the Rubber Belt, however, many tribes are quite
untouched by outside influences. The cannibal Boro and
Witoto, living between the Issa and Japura, are ignorant of
any method of producing fire, and their women go entirely
nude, though some of their arts and crafts exhibit considerable
skill, notably the plaitwork and blow-pipes of the Boro<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethnical
Relations in
Amazonia.</div>

<p>In this boundless Amazonian region of moist sunless
woodlands fringed north and east by Atlantic coast ranges,
diversified by the open Venezuelan llanos, and merging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
southwards in the vast alluvial plains of the Parana-Paraguay
basin, much light has been brought to bear
on the obscure ethnical relations by the recent
explorations especially of Paul Ehrenreich and
Karl von den Steinen about the Xingu, Purus, Madeira and
other southern affluents of the great artery<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a>. These observers
comprise the countless Brazilian aborigines in four main
linguistic divisions, which in conformity with Powell's terminology
may here be named the <span class="smcap">Cariban, Arawakan, Gesan</span> and
<span class="smcap">Tupi-Guaranian</span> families.  There remain, however, numerous
groups which cannot be so classified, such as the Bororo
and Karaya of Matto Grosso, while in the relatively small
area between the Japura and the Waupes Koch-Gr&uuml;nberg found
two other language groups, Betoya and Maku in addition to
Carib and Arawak<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Caribs.</div>

<p>Hitherto the Caribs were commonly supposed to have had
their original homes far to the north, possibly in the Alleghany
uplands, or in Florida, where they have been
doubtfully identified with the extinct Timuquanans,
and whence they spread through the Antilles southwards
to Venezuela, the Guianas, and north-east Brazil, beyond
which they were not known to have ranged anywhere south
of the Amazons. But this view is now shown to be untenable,
and several Carib tribes, such as the Baka&iuml;ri and
Nahuqua<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> of the Upper Xingu, all speaking archaic forms
of the Carib stock language, have been met by the German
explorers in the very heart of Brazil; whence the inference
that the cradle of this race is to be sought rather in the centre
of South America, perhaps on the Goyaz and Matto Grosso
table-lands, from which region they moved northwards, if not
to Florida, at least to the Caribbean Sea which is named from
them<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a>. The wide diffusion of this stock is evidenced by the
existence of an unmistakably Carib tribe in the basin of the
Rio Magdalena beyond the Andes<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a>.</p>

<p>In the north the chief groups are the Makirifare of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
Venezuela and the Macusi, Kalina, and Galibi of British,
Dutch, and French Guiana<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> respectively. In general all the
Caribs present much the same physical characters, although
the southerners are rather taller (5 ft. 4 in.) with less round
heads (index 79.6) than the Guiana Caribs (5 ft 2 in., and
81.3).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Arawakan
Family.</div>

<p>Perhaps even a greater extension has been given by the
German explorers to the Arawakan family, which, like the
Cariban, was hitherto supposed to be mainly
confined to the region north of the Amazons,
but is now known to range as far south as the
Upper Paraguay, about 20&deg; S. lat. (<i>Layana</i>, <i>Kwana</i>, etc.),
east to the Amazons estuary (<i>Aruan</i>), and north-west to the
Goajira peninsula. To this great family&mdash;which von den
Steinen proposes to call <i>Nu-Aruak</i> from the pronominal
prefix <i>nu</i> = I, common to most of the tribes&mdash;belong also the
<i>Maypures</i> of the Orinoco; the <i>Atarais</i> and <i>Vapisiana</i> of
British Guiana; the <i>Manao</i> of the Rio Negro; the <i>Yumana</i>;
the <i>Paumari</i> and <i>Ipurina</i> of the Ipuri basin; the
<i>Moxo</i> of the Upper Mamor&eacute;, and the <i>Mehinaku</i> and <i>Kustenau</i>
of the Upper Xingu.</p>

<p>Physically the Arawaks differ from the Caribs scarcely, if
at all, more than their Amazonian and Guiana sections differ
from each other. In fact, but for their radically distinct speech
it would be impossible to constitute these two ethnical divisions,
which are admittedly based on linguistic grounds.
But while the Caribs had their cradle in Central Brazil and
migrated northwards, the Arawaks would appear to have
originated in eastern Bolivia, and spread thence east, north-east
and south-east along the Amazons and Orinoco and into
the Paraguay basin<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Gesan
Family.</div>

<p>Our third great Brazilian division, the Gesan family, takes
its name from the syllable ges which, like the Araucan <i>che</i>,
forms the final element of several tribal names
in East Brazil. Of this the most characteristic
are the <i>Aimores</i> of the Serra dos Aimores coast
range, who are better known as Botocudo, and it was to the
kindred tribes of the province of Goyaz that the arbitrary
collective name of "Ges" was first applied by Martius. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
better general designation would perhaps have been <i>Tapuya</i>,
"Strangers," "Enemies," a term by which the Tupi people
called all other natives of that region who were not of their
race or speech, or rather who were not "Tupi," that is,
"Allies" or "Associates." Tapuya had been adopted somewhat
in this sense by the early Portuguese writers, who however
applied it rather loosely not only to the Aimores, but
also to a large number of kindred and other tribes as far north
as the Amazons estuary.</p>

<p>To the same connection belong several groups in Goyaz
already described by Milliet and Martius, and more recently
visited by Ehrenreich, von den Steinen and Krause. Such
are the Kayapo or Suya, a large nation with several divisions
between the Araguaya and Xingu rivers; and the
Akua, better known as Cherentes, about the upper course
of the Tocantins. Isolated Tapuyan tribes, such as the
Kam&eacute;s or Kaingangs, wrongly called "Coroados," and the
Chogleng of Santa Catharina and Rio Grand do Sul, are
scattered over the southern provinces of Brazil.</p>

<p>The Tapuya would thus appear to have formerly occupied
the whole of East Brazil from the Amazons to the Plate River
for an unknown distance inland. Here they must be regarded
as the true aborigines, who were in remote times already encroached
upon, and broken into isolated fragments, by tribes
of the Tupi-Guarani stock spreading from the interior seawards<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Botocudo.</div>

<p>But in their physical characters and extremely low cultural
state, or rather the almost total absence of anything that can
be called "culture," the Tapuya are the nearest representatives
and probably the direct descendants of the primitive race,
whose osseous remains have been found in the Lagoa Santa
caves, and the Santa Catharina shell-mounds (<i>sambaqui</i>). On
anatomic grounds the Botocudo are allied both
to the Lagoa Santa fossil man and to the <i>sambaqui</i>
race by J. R. Peixoto, who describes the skull as marked
by prominent glabella and superciliary arches, keel or roof-shaped
vault, vertical lateral walls, simple sutures, receding
brow, deeply depressed nasal root, high prognathism, massive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
lower jaw, and long head (index 73.30) with cranial capacity
1480 c.c. for men, and 1212 for women<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a>. It is also noteworthy
that some of the Botocudo<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> call themselves <i>Nacnanuk</i>,
<i>Nac-poruc</i>, "Sons of the Soil," and they have no
traditions of ever having migrated from any other land. All
their implements&mdash;spears, bow and arrows, mortars, water-vessels,
bags&mdash;are of wood or vegetable fibre, so that they
may be said not to have yet reached even the stone age.
They are not, however, in the promiscuous state, as has been
asserted, for the unions, though temporary, are jealously
guarded while they last, and, as amongst the Fuegians whom
they resemble in so many respects, the women are constantly
subject to the most barbarous treatment, beaten with clubs
or hacked about with bamboo knives. One of those in
Ribeiro's party, who visited London in 1883, had her arms,
legs, and whole body covered with scars and gashes inflicted
during momentary fits of brutal rage by her ephemeral partner.
Their dwellings are mere branches stuck in the ground, bound
together with bast, and though seldom over 4 ft. in height
accommodating two or more families. The Botocudo are
pure nomads, roaming naked in the woods in quest of the
roots, berries, honey, frogs, snakes, grubs, man, and other
larger game which form their diet, and are eaten raw or else
cooked in huge bamboo canes. Formerly they had no hammocks,
but slept without any covering, either on the ground
strewn with bast, or in the ashes of the fire kindled for the
evening meal. About their cannibalism, which has been
doubted, there is really no question. They wore the teeth
of those they had eaten strung together as necklaces, and ate
not only the foe slain in battle, but members of kindred
tribes, all but the heads, which were stuck as trophies on
stakes and used as butts for the practice of archery.</p>

<p>At the graves of the dead, fires are kept up for some time
to scare away the bad spirits, from which custom the Botocudo
might be credited with some notions concerning the
supernatural. All good influences are attributed by them to
the "day-fire" (sun), all bad things to the "night-fire" (moon),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
which causes the thunderstorm, and is supposed itself at times
to fall on the earth, crushing the hill-tops, flooding the plains
and destroying multitudes of people. During storms and
eclipses arrows are shot up to scare away the demons or devouring
dragons, as amongst so many Indo-Chinese peoples.
But beyond this there is no conception of a supreme being,
or creative force, the terms <i>yanchong</i>, <i>tapan</i>, said to mean
"God," standing merely for spirit, demon, thunder, or at most
the thunder god.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Tupi-Guaranian
Family.</div>

<p>Owing to the choice made by the missionaries of the Tupi
language as the <i>lingoa geral</i>, or common medium of intercourse
amongst the multitudinous populations of
Brazil and Paraguay, a somewhat exaggerated
idea has been formed of the range of the Tupi-Guarani
family. Many of the tribes about the stations, after
being induced by the padres to learn this convenient <i>lingua
franca</i>, were apt in course of time to forget their own mother-tongue,
and thus came to be accounted members of this
family. But allowing for such a source of error, there can be
no doubt that at the discovery the Tupi or Eastern, and the
Guarani or Western, section occupied jointly an immense
area, which may perhaps be estimated at about one-fourth of
the southern continent. Tupi tribes were met as far west as
Peru, where they were represented by the Omagua ("Flatheads<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a>"),
in French Guiana the Emerillons and the Oyampi
belong to this stock, as do the Kamayura and Auet&ouml; on the
Upper Xingu, and the Mundurucu of the middle Tapajoz.</p>

<p>Some attention has been paid to the speech of the Ticuna
of the Mara&ntilde;on, which appears to be a stock language
with strong Pana and weak Aymara<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> affinities. Although
its numeral system stops at 2, it is still in advance of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
neighbouring <i>Chiquito</i> tongue, which is said to have no
numerals at all, <i>etama</i>, supposed to be 1, really meaning
"alone."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Chiquito.</div>

<p>Yet it would be a mistake to infer that these Bolivian
Chiquito, who occupy the southernmost headstreams of the
Madeira, are a particularly stupid people. On
the contrary, the Naqui&ntilde;o&ntilde;eis, "Men," as they
call themselves, are in some respects remarkably clever, and,
strange to say, their otherwise rich and harmonious language
(presumably the dominant <i>Moncoca</i> dialect is meant) has
terms to express such various distinctions as the height of a
tree, of a house, of a tower, and other subtle shades of difference
disregarded in more cultured tongues<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a>. But it is to be
considered that, <i>pace</i> Max M&uuml;ller, the range of thought and
of speech is not the same, and all peoples have no doubt
many notions for which they have no equivalents in their
necessarily defective languages. The Chiquito, <i>i.e.</i> "Little
Folks," were so named because, "when the country was first
invaded, the Indians fled to the forests; and the Spaniards
came to their abandoned huts, where the doorways were so
exceedingly low that the Indians who had fled were supposed
to be dwarfs<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a>." They are a peaceful industrious nation, who
ply several trades, manufacture their own copper boilers for
making sugar, weave ponchos and straw hats, and when they
want blue trousers they plant a row of indigo, and rows of
white and yellow cotton when striped trousers are in fashion.
Hence the question arises, whether these clever little people
may not after all have originally possessed some defective
numeral system, which was merely superseded by the Spanish
numbers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mataco and
Toba.</div>

<p>The Gran Chaco is another area of considerable modification
induced by European influence, and there only remain
hybridised descendants of many of the ancient
peoples, for example, the Abipone of the Guaycuru
family. Pure survivals of this family are
the Mataco and Toba of the Vermejo and Pilcomayo rivers.
These two tribes were visited by Ehrenreich, who noticed
their disproportionately short arms and legs, and excessive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
development of the thorax<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a>. The daily life, customs, and
beliefs of these and other Chaco Indians have been admirably
described and illustrated by Erland Nordenski&ouml;ld<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a>, who lived
and travelled among them. The Toba and Mataco frequently
fall out with the neighbouring Choroti and Ashluslays of
the Pilcomayo anent fishing rights and so on, but the conflict
consists in ambuscades and treachery rather than in pitched
battles. Weapons consist of bows and arrows and clubs,
and lances are used on horseback. Enemies are scalped
and these trophies are greatly prized, being hung outside the
victor's hut when fine and playing a part on great occasions.
On the conclusion of peace both sides pay the blood-price for
those slain by them in sheep, horses, etc. Within the Choroti
or Ashluslay village all are equal, and though property
is held individually, the fortunate will always share with those
in want, so that theft is unknown. To kill old people or
young children is regarded as no crime<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a>.</p>

Thomas shows that "the year recorded in the Dresden codex consisted of 18 months
of 20 days each, with 5 supplemental days, or of 365 days" (<i>ib.</i>). S. G. Morley points
out (<i>Bur. Am. Eth. Bull.</i> 57, pp. 44-5) that though the Maya doubtless knew that
the true length of the year exceeded 365 days by 6 hours, yet no interpolation of
intercalary days was actually made, as this would have thrown the whole calendar
into confusion. The priests apparently corrected the calendar by additional calculations
to show how far the recorded year was ahead of the true year. Those
who have persistently appealed to these Maya-Aztec calendric systems as convincing
proofs of Asiatic influences in the evolution of American cultures will now
have to show where these influences come in. As a matter of fact the systems are
fundamentally distinct, the American showing the clearest indications of local
development, as seen in the mere fact that the day characters of the Maya codices
were phonetic, <i>i.e.</i> largely rebuses explicable only in the Maya language, which
has no affinities out of America. A careful study of the Maya calendric system
based both on the codices and the inscriptions has been made by C. P. Bowditch,
<i>The Numeration, Calendar Systems and Astronomical Knowledge of the Mayas</i>,
Cambridge, Mass. 1910. The Aztec month of 20 days is also clearly indicated by
the 20 corresponding signs on the great Calendar Stone now fixed in the wall of the
Cathedral tower of Mexico. This basalt stone, which weighs 25 tons and has a
diameter of 11 feet, is briefly described and figured by T. A. Joyce, <i>Mexican
Archaeology</i>, 1914, pp. 73, 74; cf. Pl. <small>VIII.</small> fig. 1. See also the account by
Alfredo Chavero in the <i>Anales del Museo Nacional de Mexico</i>, and an excellent

be noted that this general name of Chichimec (meaning little more than "nomadic
hunters") comprised a large number of barbarous tribes&mdash;Pames, Pintos, etc.&mdash;who
are described as wandering about naked or wearing only the skins of beasts,
living in caves or rock-shelters, armed with bows, slings, and clubs, constantly at
war amongst themselves or with the surrounding peoples, eating raw flesh, drinking
the blood of their captives or treating them with unheard-of cruelty, altogether a
horror and terror to all the more civilised communities. "Chichimec Empire"
may therefore be taken merely as a euphemistic expression for the reign of barbarism
raised up on the ruins of the early Toltec civilisation. Yet it had its
dynasties and dates and legendary sequence of events, according to the native
historian, Ixtlilxochitl, himself of royal lineage, and he states that Xolotl, founder
of the empire, had under orders 3,202,000 men and women, that his decisive
victory over the Toltecs took place in 1015, that he assumed the title of "Chichimecatl
Tecuhti," Great Chief of the Chichimecs, and that after a succession of
revolts, wars, conspiracies, and revolutions, Maxtla, last of the dynasty, was overthrown
in 1431 by the Aztecs and their allies.</p></div>

and it was a Cuban chief who even under torture refused to be baptized,
declaring that he would never enter the same heaven as the Spaniard. One is

And then the question of loan words has to be settled before any safe conclusions
can be drawn from such assumed resemblances. The point is important in the
present connection, because current statements regarding the supposed reduction
of the number of stock languages in South America are largely based on the unscientific
comparison of lists of words, which may have nothing in common except
perhaps a letter or two like the <i>m</i> in Macedon and Monmouth. Two languages
(cf. Turkish and Arabic) may have hundreds or thousands of words in common,
and yet belong to fundamentally different linguistic families.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">The Pre-Dravidians.</div>

<p>The term Pre-Dravidian, the first use of which seems to
be due to Lapicque, is now employed to include certain jungle
tribes of South India, the Vedda of Ceylon, the
Sakai of the southern Malay Peninsula, the basal
element in certain tribes in the East India Archipelago
and the main element in the Australians. Pre-Dravidian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
characters are coarse hair, more or less wavy or curly, a narrow
head, a very broad nose, dark brown skin and short stature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Kadir.</div>

<p>The following may be taken as examples of the Pre-Dravidian
jungle tribes of Southern India<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a>. The <i>Kadir</i> of the Anaimalai
Hills and the mountain ranges south into Travancore,
are of short stature (1.577 m. 5 ft. 2 in.),
with a dark skin, dolichocephalic and platyrrhine. They chip
their incisor teeth, as do the <i>Mala-Vadan</i>, and dilate the lobes
of their ears, but do not tattoo. They wear bamboo combs
similar to those of the Sakai. They speak a Tamil patois.
"The Kadirs," according to Thurston, "afford a typical example
of happiness without culture"; they are nomad hunters
and collectors of jungle products, with scarcely any tillage;
they do not possess land but have the right to collect all minor
forest produce and sell it to the Government. They deal most
extensively in wax and honey. They are polygynous. Their
dead are buried in the jungle, the head is entirely covered with
leaves and placed towards the east; there are no monuments.
Their religion is a crude polytheism with a vague worship of
stone images or invisible gods; it is "an ejaculatory religion."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Paniyan.</div>

<p>The <i>Paniyan</i>, who live in Malabar, the Wynad and the
Nilgiris, have thick and sometimes everted lips and the hair
is in some a mass of short curls, in others long
wavy curls. They are dark skinned, dolichocephalic
(index 74), platyrrhine and of short stature (1.574 m.
5 ft. 2 in.). They sometimes tattoo, and the lobes of the ears
are dilated. Fire is made by the sawing method. They are
agriculturalists and were practically serfs; they are bold and
reckless and were formerly often employed as thieves. They
speak a debased Malayalam patois. Their dead are buried;
they practise monogamy and have beliefs in various spirits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Irula.</div>

<p>The <i>Irula</i> are the darkest of the Nilgiri tribes. They are
dolichocephalic (index 75.8), platyrrhine and of low stature
(1.598 m. nearly 5 ft. 3 in.). No tattooing is recorded,
but they dilate the lobes of their ears.
Their language is a corrupt form of Tamil. They are agriculturalists
and eat all kinds of meat except that of buffaloes
and cattle. They are as a rule monogamous. Their dead
are buried in a sitting posture and the grave is marked by a
stone. Professedly they are worshippers of Vishnu.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Kurumba.</div>

<p>The jungle <i>Kurumba</i> of the Nilgiris appear to be remnants
of a great and widely spread people who erected dolmens.
They have slightly broader heads (index 77) than
allied tribes, but resemble them in their broad
nose, dark skin and low stature (1.575 m. 5 ft. 2 in.). They
cultivate the ground a little, but are essentially woodcutters,
hunters, and collectors of jungle produce. There is said to be
no marriage rite, and several brothers share a wife. Some
bury their dead. After a death a long waterworn stone is usually
placed in one of the old dolmens which are scattered over the
Nilgiri plateau, but occasionally a small dolmen is raised to
mark the burial. They have a great reputation for magical
powers. Some worship Siva, others worship Kuribattraya
(Lord of many sheep), and the wife of Siva. They also worship
a rough stone, setting it up in a cave or in a circle of
stones to which they make <i>puja</i> and offer cooked rice at the
sowing time. The Kadu Kurumba of Mysore bury children
but cremate adults; there is a separate house in each village
for unmarried girls and another at the end of the village for
unmarried males.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Vedda.</div>

<p>The <i>Vedda</i> of Ceylon have long black coarse wavy or
slightly curly hair. The cephalic index is 70.5, the nose is
depressed at the root, almost platyrrhine; the
broad face is remarkably orthognathous and the
forehead is slightly retreating with prominent brow arches;
the lips are thin, and the skin is dark brown. The stature is
extremely low, only 1.533 m. (5 ft. 0&frac12; in.). The Coast and
less pure Vedda average 43 mm. (1&frac34; in.) taller and have
broader heads. The true Vedda are a grave but happy
people, quiet, upright, hospitable with a strong love of liberty.
Lying and theft are unknown. They are timid and have a
great fear of strangers. The bow and arrow are their only
weapons and the arrow tipped with iron obtained from the
Sinhalese forms a universal tool. They speak a modified
Sinhali, but employ only one numeral and count with sticks.
They live under rock shelters or in simple huts made of boughs.
They are strictly monogamous and live in isolated families
with no chiefs and have no regular clan meetings. Each
section of the Vedda had in earlier days its own hunting
grounds where fish, game, honey, and yams constituted their
sole food. The wild Vedda simply leave their dead in a cave,
which is then deserted. The three things that loom largest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
in the native mind are hunting, honey, and the cult of the
dead. The last constitutes almost the whole of the religious
life and magical practices of the people; it is the <i>motif</i> of
almost every dance and may have been the source of all.
After a death they perform certain dances and rites through a
<i>shaman</i> in connection with the recently departed ghost, <i>yaka</i>.
They also propitiate powerful <i>yaku</i>, male and female, by
sacrifices and ceremonial dances<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sakai.</div>

<p>The <i>Sakai</i> or <i>Senoi</i> are jungle folk, some of whom have
mixed with Semang and other peoples. Their skin is of a
medium brown colour. Their hair is long, mainly
wavy or loosely curly, and black with a reddish
tinge. The average stature may be taken to be from 1.5 m.
to 1.55 m. (59 to 61 inches), the head index varies from about
77 to 81. The face is fairly broad, with prominent cheek-bones
and brow ridges; the low broad nose has spreading alae and
short concave ridge; the lips are thick but not everted. They
are largely nomadic, and their agriculture is of the most primitive
description, their usual implement being the digging stick.
Their houses are built on the ground and as a rule are rectangular
in plan though occasionally conical, and huts are
sometimes built in trees as refuges from wild beasts. A scanty
garment of bark cloth was formerly worn, and, like the Semang,
they make fringed girdles from a black thread-like fungus.
Their distinctive weapon is the blow-pipe which they have
brought to great perfection, and their food consists in jungle
produce, including many poisonous roots and tubers which
they have learnt how to treat, so as to render them innocuous.
They do not make canoes and rarely use rafts. In the marriage
ceremony the man has to chase the girl round a mound of
earth and catch her before she has encircled it a third time.
The marriage tie is strictly observed. Each village has a
petty chief, whose influence is purely personal. Individual
property does not exist, only family property. Cultivation is
also communal. The inhabitants of the upper heaven consist
of Tuhan or Peng, the "god" of the Sakai and a giantess
named "Granny Long-breasts" who washes sin-blackened
human souls in hot water; the good souls ultimately go to a
cloud-land. There are numerous demons and whenever the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>

attack them, and there is no contending against his decree.
He is not prayed to, as his will is unalterable<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Toala.</div>

<p>The <i>Toala</i> of the south-west peninsula of the Celebes are
at base, according to the Sarasins<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a>, a Pre-Dravidian people,
though some mixture with other races has taken
place. The hair is very wavy and even curly,
the skin darkish brown, the head low brachycephalic (index 82)
and the stature 1.575 m. (5 ft. 2 in.). The face is somewhat
short with very broad nose and thick lips. Possibly the <i>Ulu
Ayar</i> of west Borneo who are related to the Land Dayaks may
be partly of Pre-Dravidian origin and other traces of this race
will probably be found in the East India Archipelago<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Australia:
Physical
Conditions.</div>

<p>Australia resembles South Africa in the arid conditions
characterising the interior, the eastern range of mountains
precipitating the warm moisture-laden winds
from the Pacific. As a result of the restricted
rainfall there is no river system of importance
except that of the Murray and its tributary the Darling. In
the north and north-east, owing to heavier rainfall, there are
numerous water-courses, but they do not open up the interior
of the country. The lack of uniformity in the water supply
has a far-reaching effect on all living beings. The arid conditions,
the irregularity and short duration of the rainfall oblige
the natives to be continually migrating, and prevent these
unsettled bands from ever attaining any size, indeed they are
sometimes hard pressed to obtain enough food to keep alive.</p>

<p>It may be assumed that the backwardness of the culture
of the Australians is due partly to the low state of culture of
their ancestors when they arrived in the country, and partly
to the peculiar character of the country as well as of its flora
and fauna, since Australia has never been stocked with wild
animals dangerous to human life, or with any suitable for
domestication. The relative isolation from other peoples has
had a retarding effect and the Australian has developed largely
along his own lines without the impetus given by competition
with other peoples. Records of simple migration are rare.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
There have been no waves of aggression, and intertribal feuds
are not very serious affairs. The Australians have never influenced
any other peoples and they are doomed gradually to
disappear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physical
Type.</div>

<p>Baldwin Spencer says "In the matter of personal appearance
while conforming generally to what is known as the Australian
type, there is considerable variation. The man
varies from, approximately, a maximum of 6 ft. 3 in.
to a minimum of 5 ft. 2 in.... As a general rule,
few of them are taller than 5 ft. 8 in. The women vary between
5 ft. 9 in. and 4 ft. 9 in. Their average height is not
more than 5 ft. 2 in. The brow ridges are strongly marked,
especially in the man, and the forehead slopes back. The nose
is broad with the root deep set.  In colour the native is dark
chocolate brown, not black. The hair ... may be almost straight,
decidedly wavy&mdash;its usual feature&mdash;or almost, but never really,
frizzly.... The beard also may be well developed or almost
absent<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a>." The skull is dolichocephalic with an average cranial
index of 72, prognathous and platyrrhine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Australian
Origins.</div>

<p>There has been much speculation with regard to the origin
of the present Australian race. According to Baldwin Spencer
"There can be no doubt but that in past times
the whole of the continent, including Tasmania,
was occupied by one race. This original, and
probably Negritto<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> population, at an early period; was widely
spread over Malayasia and Australia including Tasmania,
which at that time was not shut off by Bass Strait. The
Tasmanians had no boats capable of crossing the latter and
[it is assumed that their ancestors] must have gone over on
land<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a>."</p>

<p>Subsequently when the land sank a remnant of the old
ulotrichous population "was thus left stranded in Tasmania,
where <i>Homo tasmanianus</i> survived until he came in contact
with Europeans and was exterminated." He had frizzly hair.
"His weapons and implements were of the most primitive
kind; long pointed unbarbed spears, no spear thrower, no
boomerang, simple throwing stick and only the crudest form
of chipped stone axes, knives and scrapers that were never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
hafted. Unfortunately of his organisation, customs, and
beliefs we know but little in detail<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a>."</p>

<p>It is now generally held that at a later date an immigration
of a people in a somewhat higher stage of culture took place;
these are regarded by some as belonging to the Dravidian,
and by others, and with more probability, to the Pre-Dravidian
race. J. Mathew<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> suggests that "the two races are represented
by the two primary classes, or phratries, of Australian society,
which were generally designated by names indicating a contrast
of colour, such as eaglehawk and crow. The crow, black
cockatoo, etc., would represent the Tasmanian element; the
eaglehawk, white cockatoo, etc., the so-called Dravidian."
Baldwin Spencer does not think that the moiety names lend
any serious support to the theory of the mixture of two races
differing in colour. He goes on to say "Mr Mathew also
postulates a comparatively recent slight infusion of Malay
blood in the northern half of Australia. There is, however,
practically no evidence of Malay infusion. One of the most
striking features of the Malay is his long, lank hair, and yet
it is just in these north parts that the most frizzly hair is met
with<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidence from
Language and
Culture.</div>

<p>As concerns linguistics S. H. Ray says "There is no
evidence of an African, Andaman, Papuan, or Malay connection
with the Australian languages. There
are reasons for regarding the Australian as in a
similar morphological stage to the Dravidian,
but there is no genealogical relationship proved<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a>." No connection
has yet been proved between the Australian languages
and the Austronesian or Oceanic branch of the Austric family
of languages, first systematically described by W. Schmidt<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a>.
The study of Australian languages is particularly difficult
owing to the very few serviceable grammars and dictionaries,
and the large number of very incomplete vocabularies scattered
about in inaccessible works and journals. The main conclusion
to which Schmidt has arrived<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> is that the Australian languages
are not, as had been supposed, a mainly uniform group. Though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
over the greater part of Australia languages possess strong
common elements, North Australia has languages showing no
similarities in vocabulary and very few in grammar with that
larger group or with each other. The area of the North
Australian languages is included in a line from south of Roebuck
Bay in the west to Cape Flattery in the east, with a
southward bend to include Arunta (Aranda), interrupted by a
branch of southern languages running up north down Flinders
and Leichhardt rivers<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a>. The area contains two or three linguistic
groups, best distinguished by their terminations which consist
respectively of vowels and consonants, the oldest group; vowels
alone, the latest group; and vowels and liquids, probably representing
a transition between the two.</p>

<p>In South Australia, though differences occur, the languages
possess common features both in grammar and vocabulary,
having similar personal pronouns, and certain words for parts
of the body in common. Linguistic differences are associated
with differences in social grouping, the area of purely vowel
endings coinciding with the area of the 2-class system and
matrilinear descent, while the area of liquid endings is partly
coterminous with the 4-class system and (often) patrilinear
succession.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Four successive
Immigrations.</div>

<p>Schmidt endeavours to trace the connection between the
distribution of languages with that of types of social groupings,
more particularly in connection with the culture
zones which Graebner<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> has traced throughout
the Pacific area, representing successive waves
of migration. The first immigration, corresponding with
Graebner's <i>Ur-period</i>, is represented by languages with postposed
genitive, the earliest stratum being pure only in Tasmania;
remnants of the first stratum and a second stratum
occur in Victoria, and remnants of the second stratum to the
north and north-east. According to Schmidt this cultural
stratum is characterised by absence of group or marriage
totemism, and presence of sex patrons ("sex-totemism"). The
second immigration is represented by languages with preposition
of the genitive, initial <i>r</i> and <i>l</i>, vowel and explosive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
endings, and is found fairly pure only in the extreme north-west
and north, and in places in the north-east. The great
multiplicity of languages belonging to this stratum may be attributed
to the predominance of the strictly local type of totem-groups.
These are the languages of Graebner's "totem-culture."
The third immigration is represented by languages with preposition
of the genitive, no initial <i>r</i> and <i>l</i>, and purely vowel
terminations. These are the languages of the south central
group of tribes with a 2-class system and matrilinear descent.
This uniform group has the largest area and has influenced
the whole mass of Australian languages, only North Australia
and Tasmania remaining immune. Their sociological structure
with no localisation of totems and classes contributed to their
power of expansion. The fourth immigration is represented
by languages of an intermediate type, with vowel and liquid
endings but no initial <i>r</i> and <i>l</i>. These are the tribes with 4-class
and 8-class systems, universal father-right (proving the strong
influence of older totemic ideas), curious fertility rites, conception
ideas and migration myths.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Earlier Views.</div>

<p>It will be seen that Schmidt's conclusions confute the
evolutionary theory developed by Frazer, Hartland, Howitt,
Spencer and Gillen, Durkheim and (in part)
Andrew Lang, that Australia was essentially
homogeneous in fundamental ideas which have developed
differently on account of geographic and climatic variation.
Schmidt's view is that Australia was entered successively by
a number of entirely different tribes, so that the variation now
met with is due to radical diversities and to the numerous
intermixtures arising from migrations and stratifications of
peoples. The linguistic data dispose of the idea that the
oldest tribes with mother-right, 2-class system, traces of
group-marriage, and lack of moral and religious ideas live in
the centre, and that from thence advancement radiated towards
the coast bringing about father-right, abandonment of class
system and totemism, individual marriage, and higher ethical
and religious ideas. On the contrary it would appear that the
centre of the continent is the great channel in which movements
are still taking place; the older peoples are driven out towards
the margin and there preserve the old sociological, ethical and
religious conditions. In fact, the older the people, judging
from their linguistic stratum, the less one finds among them
what has been assumed to be the initial stage for Central<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
Australia<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a>. These are Schmidt's views and they confirm the
cultural results established by Graebner. But as the whole
question of the culture layers in the Pacific is still under
discussion it is inadvisable at this stage of our knowledge to
make any definite statements. It is worth noting, however,
that<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> the distribution of simple burial of the dead coincides in
the main with Schmidt's South Australian language area, and
the area roughly enclosed on the east by long. 140&deg; E. and the
north by lat. 20&deg; S. appears to form a technological province
distinct from the rest of Australia<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Material
Culture.</div>

<p>Rarely can the Australian depend on regular supplies of
food. He feeds on flesh, fish, grubs and insects, and wild
vegetable food; probably everything that is
edible is eaten. Cannibalism is widely spread,
but human flesh is nowhere a regular article of
food. Clothing, apart from ornament, is rarely worn, but in
the south, skin cloaks and fur aprons are fairly common.
Scarification of the body is frequent and conspicuous. The
men usually let their hair grow long, and the women keep
theirs short. Dwellings are of the simplest character, usually
merely breakwinds or slight huts, but where there is a large
supply of vegetable food, huts are made of boughs covered
with bark or grass and are sometimes coated with clay. Implements
are made of shell, bone, wood and stone. Baldwin
Spencer remarks "It is not too much to say that at the present
time we can parallel amongst Australian stone weapons all the
types known in Europe under the names Chellean, Mousterian,
Aurignacian etc.... The terms Eolithic, Palaeolithic, and Neolithic
do not apply in Australia as indicating either time periods
or levels of culture<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a>." Spears and wooden clubs are universal,
and the use of the spear-thrower is generally distributed. The
boomerang is found almost throughout Australia; the variety
that returns when it is thrown is as a rule only a plaything or
for throwing at birds. The forms of the various implements
vary in different parts of the country and in some districts
certain implements may be entirely absent. For example the
boomerang is not found in the northern parts of Cape York
peninsula or of the Northern Territory, and the spear-thrower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
is absent from south-east Queensland. Bows and arrows are
unknown and pottery making does not occur. Rafts are made
of one or more logs, and the commonest form of canoe is that
made of a single sheet of bark. Dug-outs occur in a few places,
and both single and double outriggers are found only on the
Queensland coast. These sporadic occurrences give additional
support to the modern view that the racial and cultural history
of Australia is by no means so simple as has till lately been
assumed<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sociology.</div>

<p>Students of Australian sociology have been so much impressed
with certain prominent features of social organisation
that they have paid insufficient attention to
kinship and the family; the former has however
recently been investigated by A. R. Brown<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a>, while information
concerning the latter has been carefully sifted by B. Malinowski<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a>.
The main features of social groupings are the tribe, the local
groups, the classes, the totemic clans and the families. A tribe
is composed of a number of local groups and these are perpetuated
in the same tracts by the sons, who hunt over the
grounds of their fathers; this is the "local organisation."
The local group is the only political unit, and <i>intra</i>-group
justice has been extended to <i>inter</i>-group justice, where the
units of reference are not based on kinship; this may be regarded
as the earliest stage of what is known as International
Law<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a>. In the so-called "social organisation," the tribe as a
community is divided into two parts (moieties or phratries),
which are quite distinct from the local groups, though rarely
they may be coincident.  Each moiety may be subdivided
into two or four exogamous sections which are generally called
"classes" and are peculiar to Australia. Descent in the classes
is as a rule indirect matrilineal or indirect patrilineal, that is to
say, while the child still belongs to its mother's or father's
moiety (as the case may be) it is assigned to the class to which
the mother or the father does not belong; but the grandchildren
belong to the class of a grandmother or grandfather.
In diagram I (below) <i>A</i> and <i>C</i> are classes of one moiety,
<b>B</b> and <i>D</i> those of the other. Thus when <i>A</i> man marries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
<i>B</i> woman the children are <i>D</i>. <i>B</i> man marries <i>A</i> woman and
the children are <i>C</i> and so on. When there are four classes in
each moiety the diagram works out as follows (II)<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a>:</p>

</div>

<p>Very important in social life are the initiation ceremonies
by means of which a youth is admitted to the status of tribal
manhood. These ceremonies vary greatly from tribe to tribe
but they agree in certain fundamental points. "(1) They
begin at the age of puberty. (2) During the initiation ceremonies
the women play an important part. (3) At the close
of the first part of the ceremonies, such as that of tooth
knocking out or circumcision, a definite performance is enacted
emblematic of the fact that the youths have passed out of the
control of the women. (4) During the essential parts the
women are typically absent and the youths are shown the bull-roarer,
have the secret beliefs explained to them and are
instructed in the moral precepts and customs, including food
restrictions, that they must henceforth observe under severe
penalties. (5) The last grade is not passed through until a
man is quite mature<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Totemism.</div>

<p>Practically universal is the existence of a grouping of
individuals under the names of plants, animals or various
objects; these are termed totems and the human
groups are termed totem clans. The members
of a totem clan commonly believe themselves to be actually
descended from or related to their totem, and all members of
a clan, whatever tribe they may belong to, are regarded as
brethren, who have mutual duties, prohibitions and privileges.
Thus a member of a totem clan must help and never injure
any fellow member. "Speaking generally it may be said that
every totemic group has certain ceremonies associated with it
and that these refer to old totemic ancestors. In all tribes
they form part of a secret ritual in which only the initiated
may take part. In most tribes a certain number are shown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
to the youths during the early stages of initiation, but at a later
period he sees many more<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a>."</p>

<p>In several tribes, and probably it was very general, certain
magical ceremonies were performed to render the totem
abundant or efficacious. The sex patron ("sex totem"), when
the women have one animal, such as the owlet night-jar
associated with them, and the men another, such as the bat;
and the guardian genius (mis-called "individual totem"),
acquired by dreaming of some animal, are of rare occurrence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Family.</div>

<p>The individual family has been shown by Malinowski<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> to
be "a unit playing an important part in the social life of the
natives and well defined by a number of moral,
customary and legal norms; it is further determined
by the sexual division of labour, the aboriginal mode
of living, and especially by the intimate relation between the
parents and children. The individual relation between husband
and wife (marriage) is rooted in the unity of the family ... and
in the well-defined, though not always exclusive, sexual right
the husband acquires over his wife." All sexual licence is
regulated by and subject to strict rules. The <i>Pirrauru</i>
custom, by which individuals are allocated accessory spouses,
"proves that the relationship involved does not possess the
character of marriage. For it completely differs from marriage
in nearly all the essential points by which marriage in Australia
is defined. And above all the Pirrauru relation does not seem
to involve the facts of family life in its true sense" (p. 298).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kinship.</div>

<p>A. R. Brown<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> asserts that so far as our information goes,
the only method of regulating marriage is by means of the
relationship system. In every tribe there is a law
to the effect that a man may only marry women
who stand to him in a certain relationship, and there is no
evidence that there is any other method of regulating marriage.
The so-called class rule by which a man of a special division
or group is required to marry a woman of another division is
merely the law of relationship stated in a less exact form. It
is the fact that a man may only marry a relative of a certain
kind that necessitates the marrying into a particular relationship
division. The rule of totemic exogamy, according to A. R.
Brown, is equally seen to have no existence apart from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
relationship rule. Where a totemic group is a clan and consists
of relations all of one line of descent, a man is prohibited
from marrying a woman of his own group by the ordinary rule
of relationship. On the other hand, where the totemic group
is not a clan, but is a local group (as in the Burduna tribe) or
a cult society (as in the Arunta tribe) there is no rule prohibiting
a man from marrying a woman of the same totemic
group as himself. The so-called rule of local exogamy in some
tribes (perhaps in all) is merely a result of the fact that the
local group is a clan, <i>i.e.</i> a group of persons related in one line
of descent only. Only two methods of regulating marriage
are known to exist in the greater part of Australia<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a>: Type I.
A man marries the daughter of one of the men he denotes by
the same term as his mother's brother. Type II. A man
marries a woman who is the daughter's daughter of some man
whom he denotes by the same term as his mother's mother's
brother. In either case he may not marry any other kind of
relative. The existence of two phratries or moieties or four
named divisions ("classes") in a tribe conveys no information
whatever as to the marriage rule of the tribe. The term
"class" and "sub-class," according to A. R. Brown, had better
be discarded as writers use them to denote several totally
distinct kinds of divisions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Property and
Trade.</div>

<p>The tribe has collecting and hunting rights over an area
with recognised limits, smaller communities down to the family
unit having similar rights within the tribal
boundaries. In some cases a tribe which had
no stone suitable for making stone implements
within its own boundaries was allowed to send tribal messengers
to a quarry to procure what was needed without molestation,
though Howitt speaks of family ownership of quarries<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a>. Implements
are personal property. An extensive system of
intertribal communication and exchange is carried on, apparently
by recognised middlemen, and tribes meet on certain
occasions at established trade centres for a regulated barter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic and
Religion.</div>

<p>Beneficent and malevolent magic are universally practised
and totemism possesses a religious besides a social aspect.
An emotional relation often exists between the
members of a totem clan and their totem, and
the latter are believed at times to warn or protect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
their human kinsmen. It may be noted that the widely
spread and elaborate ceremonies designed to render the
totem prolific or to ensure its abundance, though performed
solely by members of the totem clan concerned, are less for
their own benefit than for that of the community<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a>. Owing
perhaps to the difficulty of distinguishing between the purely
social and the religious institutions of primitive peoples great
diversity of opinion prevails even amongst the best observers
regarding the religious views of the Australian aborigines.
The existence of a "tribal All-Father" is perhaps most clearly
emphasised by A. W. Howitt<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a>, who finds this belief widespread
in the whole of Victoria and New South Wales, up
to the eastern boundaries of the tribes of the Darling River.
Amongst those of New South Wales are the Euahlayi, whom
K. Langloh Parker describes<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> as having a more advanced
theology and a more developed worship (including prayers,
pp. 79-80) than any other Australian tribe. These now eat
their hereditary totem without scruple&mdash;a sure sign that the
totemic system is dying out, although still outwardly in full
force. Amongst the Arunta, Kaitish, and the other Central
and Northern tribes studied by Spencer and Gillen, totemism
still survives, and totems are even assigned to the mysterious
<i>Iruntarinia</i> entities, vague and invisible incarnations of the
ghosts of ancestors who lived in the <i>Alcheringa</i> time, the dim
remote past at the beginning of everything. These are far
more powerful than living men, because their spirit part is
associated with the so-called <i>churinga</i>, consisting of stones,
pieces of wood or any other objects which are deemed sacred
as possessing a kind of <i>mana</i> which makes the yams and grass
to grow, enables a man to capture game, and so forth. "That
the <i>churinga</i> are simply objects endowed with <i>mana</i> is the
happy suggestion of Sidney Hartland<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> whose explanation has
dispelled the dense fog of mystification hitherto enveloping
the strange beliefs and observances of these Central and
Northern tribes<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a>." N. W. Thomas<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> reviews the whole question
of Australian religion, and after describing Twanjiraka,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>

of the Narrinyeri, Bunjil or Pundjel, often called Mamingorak
(our father) of Victoria, and others, he concludes "These are
by no means the only gods known to Australian tribes; on
the contrary it can hardly be definitely asserted that there is
or was any tribe which had not some such belief<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
Considerations.</div>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that the Caucasic division of the
human family, of which nearly all students of the subject are
members, with which we are in any case, so to
say, on the most intimate terms, and with the
constituent elements of which we might consequently
be supposed to be best acquainted, is the most
debatable field in the whole range of anthropological studies.
Why this should be so is not at first sight quite apparent,
though the phenomenon may perhaps be partly explained by
the consideration that the component parts are really of a more
complex character, and thus present more intricate problems
for solution, than those of any other division. But to some
extent this would also seem to be one of those cases in which
we fail to see the wood for the trees. To put it plainly, few
will venture to deny that the inherent difficulties of the subject
have in recent times been rather increased than diminished by
the bold and often mutually destructive theories, and, in some
instances one might add, the really wild speculations put
forward in the earnest desire to remove the endless obscurities
in which the more fundamental questions are undoubtedly still
involved. Controversial matter which seemed thrashed out
has been reopened, several fresh factors have been brought
into play, and the warfare connected with such burning topics
as Aryan origins, Ibero-Pelasgic relations, European round-heads
and long-heads, has acquired renewed intensity amid
the rival theories of eminent champions of new ideas.</p>

<p>The question is not made any simpler by the frequent
attacks that have been directed from more than one quarter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
against the long-established Caucasic terminology, and well-supported
objections are raised to the use of such time-honoured
names as "Hamitic," "Semitic," and even "Caucasic" itself.
But no really satisfactory substitute for "Caucasic" has yet
been suggested, and it is doubtful if any name could be found
sufficiently comprehensive to include all the races, long-headed
and short-headed, fair and dark, tall and short, that we are at
present content to group under this non-committal heading.
Undoubtedly the term "Caucasic" cannot be defended on
ethnical grounds. "Nowhere else in the world probably is
so heterogeneous a lot of people, languages and religions
gathered together in one place as along the chain of the
Caucasus mountains<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a>." But we are no more called upon to
believe that the "Caucasic" peoples originated in the Caucasus,
than that the Semites are all descendants of Shem or Hamites
of Ham. "Caucasic" has one claim that can never be disputed,
that of priority, and it would be well if innovators in
these matters were to take to heart the sober language of
Ehrenreich, who reminds us that the accepted names are,
what they ought to be, "purely conventional," and "historically
justified," and "should be held as valid until something better
can be found to take their place<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a>." It was considerations such
as these, weighing so strongly in favour of current usage, that
induced me <i>stare per vias antiquas</i> in the <i>Ethnology</i>, and consequently
also in the present work. Hence, here as there,
the Caucasic Division retains its title, together with those of
its main subdivisions&mdash;Hamitic, Semitic, Keltic, Slavic, Hellenic,
Teutonic, Iranic, Galchic and so on.</p>

<p>The chief exception is "Aryan," a linguistic expression
forced by the philologists into the domain of Ethnology, where
it has no place or meaning. There was of course a time when
a community, or group of communities, existed probably in the
steppe region between the Carpathians and the Hindu-Kush<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
by whom the Aryan mother-tongue was evolved, and who still
for a time presented a certain uniformity in their physical
characters, were, in fact, of Aryan speech and type. But while
their Aryan speech persists in endlessly modified forms, they
have themselves long disappeared as a distinct race, merged
in the countless other races on whom they, perhaps as conquerors,
imposed their Aryan language. Hence we can and
must speak of Aryan tongues, and of an Aryan linguistic
family, which continues to flourish and spread over the globe.
But of an Aryan race there can be no further question since
the absorption of the original stock in a hundred other races
in remote prehistoric times. Where comprehensive references
have to be made, I therefore substitute for Aryans and Aryan
race the expression peoples of Aryan speech, at least wherever
the unqualified term Aryan might lead to misunderstandings.</p>

<p>This way of looking at the question, which has now become
more thorny than ever, has the signal advantage of being indifferent
to any preconceived theories regarding the physical
characters of that long vanished proto-Aryan race. How great
this advantage is may be judged from the mere statement that,
while German anthropologists are still almost to a man loyal
to the traditional view that the first Aryans were best represented
by the tall, long-headed, tawny-haired, blue-eyed
Teutonic barbarians of Tacitus&mdash;who, Virchow tells us, have
completely disappeared from sight in the present population&mdash;the
Italian school, or at least its chief exponent, Sergi, was
equally convinced that the picture was a myth, that such
Aryans never existed, that "the true primitive Aryans were
not long, but round-headed, not fair but dark, not tall but
short, and are in fact to-day best represented by the round-headed
Kelts, Slavs, and South Germans<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a>."</p>

<p>The fact is that the Aryan prototype has vanished as
completely as has the Aryan mother-tongue, and can be conjecturally
restored only by processes analogous to those by
which Schleicher and other philologists have endeavoured
with dubious success to restore the organic Aryan speech as
constituted before the dispersion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constituent
Elements.</div>

<p>But here arises the more important question, by what right
are so many and such diverse peoples grouped together and
ticketed "Caucasians"? Are they to be really taken as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>objectively one, or are they merely artificial groupings, arbitrarily
arranged abstractions? Certainly this
Caucasic division consists apparently of the
most heterogeneous elements, more so than
perhaps any other. Hence it seems to require a strong
mental effort to sweep into a single category, however elastic,
so many different peoples&mdash;Europeans, North Africans, West
Asiatics, Iranians and others all the way to the Indo-Gangetic
plains and uplands, whose complexion presents every shade of
colour, except yellow, from white to the deepest brown or
even black.</p>

<p>But they are grouped together in a single division, because
of certain common characteristics, and because, as pointed out
by Ehrenreich, who himself emphasises these objections, their
substantial uniformity speaks to the eye that sees below the
surface. At the first glance, except perhaps in a few extreme
cases for which it would be futile to create independent categories,
we recognise a common racial stamp in the facial
expression, the structure of the hair, partly also the bodily
proportions, in all of which points they agree more with each
other than with the other main divisions. Even in the case
of certain black or very dark races, such as the Beja, Somali,
and a few other Eastern Hamites, we are reminded instinctively
more of Europeans or Berbers than of negroes, thanks to their
more regular features and brighter expression. "Those who
will accept nothing unless it can be measured, weighed, and
numbered, may think perhaps that according to modern notions
this appeal to the outward expression is unscientific. Nevertheless
nobody can deny the evidence of the obvious physical
differences between Caucasians, African Negroes, Mongols,
Australians and so on. After all, physical anthropology itself
dates only from the moment when we became conscious of
these differences, even before we were able to give them exact
expression by measurements. It was precisely the general
picture that spoke powerfully and directly to the eye<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a>." The
argument need not here be pursued farther, as it will receive
abundant illustration in the details to follow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Past and
Present Range.</div>

<p>Since the discovery of the New and the Austral Worlds,
the Caucasic division as represented by the chief European
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>nations has received an enormous expansion. Here of course
it is necessary to distinguish between political and ethnical
conquests, as, for instance, those of India, held by military
tenure, and of Australia by actual settlement. Politically the
whole world has become Caucasic with the exception of half-a-dozen
states such as China, Turkey, Japan, Siam, Marocco,
still enjoying a real or fictitious autonomy. But, from the
ethnical standpoint, those regions in which the Caucasic peoples
can establish themselves and perpetuate their race as colonists
are alone to be regarded as fresh accessions to the original and
later (historical) Caucasic domains. Such fresh accessions are
however of vast extent, including the greater part of Siberia
and adjoining regions, where Slav branches of the Aryan-speaking
peoples are now founding permanent new homes;
the whole of Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand, which
have become the inheritance of the Caucasic inhabitants of the
British Isles; large tracts in South Africa, already occupied
by settlers chiefly from Holland and Great Britain; lastly the
New World, where most of the northern continent is settled
by full-blood Europeans, mainly British, French and German,
while in the rest (Central and South America) the Caucasic
immigrants (chiefly from the Iberian peninsula) have formed
new ethnical groups by fusion with the aborigines. These new
accessions, all acquired within the last 400 years,
may be roughly estimated at about 28 million
square miles, which with some 12 millions held
throughout the historic period (Africa north of Sudan, most of
Europe, South-West and parts of Central and South Asia,
Indonesia) gives an extent of 40 million square miles to the
present Caucasic domain, either actually occupied or in process
of settlement. As the whole of the dry land scarcely exceeds
52 millions, this leaves not more than about 12 millions for
the now reduced domains of all the other divisions, and even
of this a great part (<i>e.g.</i> Tibetan table-land, Gobi, tundras,
Greenland) is barely or not at all inhabitable. This, it may
be incidentally remarked, is perhaps the best reply to those
who have in late years given expression to gloomy forebodings
regarding the ultimate fate of the Caucasic races. The "yellow
scare" may be dismissed with the reflection that the Caucasian
populations, who have inherited or acquired nearly four-fifths
of the earth's surface besides the absolute dominion of the high
seas, is not destined to be submerged by any conceivable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
combination of all the other elements, still less by the Mongol
alone<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Caucasic Cradle&mdash;North
Africa.</div>

<p>Where have we to seek the primeval home of this most
vigorous and dominant branch of the human family? Since
no direct evidence can be cited, the answer
necessarily takes the form of a hypothesis, and
must rely mainly on the indirect evidence supplied
by our vague knowledge of geographical conditions in pleistocene
times, on past and present zoological distributions, with
here and there, the assistance of a hint gleaned from archaeological
discoveries. We may deal first with the arguments
brought forward in favour of Africa north of Sudan. Here
were found in quaternary times all the physical elements which
zoologists demand for great specialisations&mdash;ample space, a
favourable climate and abundance of food, besides continuous
land connection at two or three points across the Mediterranean,
by which the pliocene and early pleistocene faunas moved
freely between the two continents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The "Quaternary
Sahara."</div>

<p>Many of the speculations on the subject failed to convince,
largely because the writers took, so to say, the ground from
under their own feet, by submerging most of the
land under a vast "Quaternary Sahara Sea,"
which had no existence, and which, moreover,
reduced the whole of North Africa to a Mauretanian island,
a mere "appendix of Europe," as it is in one place expressly
called. Then this inconvenient inland basin was got rid of,
not by an outflow&mdash;being on the same level as the Atlantic,
of which it was, in fact figured as an inlet&mdash;but by "evaporation,"
which process is however somehow confined to this
inlet, and does not affect either the Mediterranean or the
Atlantic itself. Nor is it explained how the oceanic waters
were prevented from rushing in according "as the Sahara sea
evaporated to become a desert." The attempt to evolve a
"Eurafrican race" in such an impossible area necessarily
broke down, other endless perplexities being involved in the
initial geological misconception.</p>

<p>Not only was the Sahara dry land in pleistocene times,
but it stood then at a considerably higher altitude than at
present, although its mean elevation is still estimated by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
Chavanne at 1500 feet above sea-level. "Quaternary deposits
cover wide areas, and were at one time supposed to be
of marine origin. It was even held that the great sand dunes
must have been formed under the sea; but at this date it is
scarcely necessary to discuss such a view. The advocates of
a Quaternary Sahara Sea argued chiefly from the discovery
of marine shells at several points in the middle of the Sahara.
But Tournou&euml;r has shown that to call in the aid of a great
ocean in order to explain the presence of one or two shells is
a needless expenditure of energy<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a>."</p>

<p>At an altitude of probably over 2000 feet the Sahara must
have enjoyed an almost ideal climate during late pliocene and
pleistocene times, when Europe was exposed to more than one
glacial invasion, and to a large extent covered at long intervals
by a succession of solid ice-caps. We now know that these
stony and sandy wastes were traversed in all directions by
great rivers, such as the Massarawa trending south to the
Niger, or the Igharghar<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> flowing north to the Mediterranean,
and that these now dry beds may still be traced for hundreds
of miles by chains of pools or lakelets, by long eroded valleys
and by other indications of the action of running waters.</p>

<p>Nor could there be any lack of vegetable or animal life in
a favoured region, which was thus abundantly supplied with
natural irrigation arteries, while the tropical heats were tempered
by great elevation and at times by the refreshing breezes from
sub-arctic Europe.</p>

<p>From these well-watered and fertile lands, some of which
continued even in Roman times to be the granary of the empire,
came that succession of southern animals&mdash;hippopotamus,
hyaena, rhinoceros, elephant, cave-lion&mdash;which made Europe
seem like a "zoological appendix of Africa." In association
with this fauna may have come man himself, for although
North Africa has not yet yielded evidence of a widespread
culture comparable to that of the Palaeolithic Age in Europe,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
yet the negroid characters of the Grimaldi skeletons have been
held to prove an early connection between the opposite shores
of the Mediterranean. The hypothesis of African origin is
supported by archaeological evidence of the presence of early
man all over North Africa from the shores of the Mediterranean
through Egypt to Somaliland. Thus one of J. de Morgan's
momentous conclusions was that the existence of civilised men
in Egypt might be reckoned by thousands, and of the aborigines
by myriads of years. These aborigines he identified with the
men of the Old Stone Age, of whom he believed four stations
to have been discovered&mdash;Dahshur, Abydos, Tukh, and
Thebes<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a>.</p>

<p>Of Tunisia Ars&egrave;ne Dumont declared that "the immense
period of time during which man made use of stone implements
is nowhere so strikingly shown." Here some of the flints were
found in abundance under a thick bed of quaternary limestone
deposited by the waters of a stream that has disappeared.
Hence "the origin of man in Mauretania must be set back to
a remote age which deranges all chronology and confounds
the very fables of the mythologies<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a>."</p>

<p>The skeleton found in 1914 by Hans Reck at Oldoway
(then German East Africa) was claimed to be of Pleistocene
Age, but according to A. Keith "the evidence ... cannot be
accepted as having finally proved this degree of antiquity<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a>."</p>

<p>The doctrine of the specialisation of the dolichocephalic
European types in Africa, before their migrations northwards,
lies at the base of Sergi's views regarding the African origin
of those types. Arguing against the Asiatic origin of the
Hamites, as held by Prichard, Virchow, Sayce and others, he
points out that this race, scarcely if at all represented in Asia,
has an immense range in Africa, where its several sub-varieties
must have been evolved before their dispersion over a great
part of that continent and of Europe. Then, regarding
Hamites and Semites as essentially one, he concludes that
Africa is the cradle whence this primitive stock "spread
northwards to Europe, where it still persists, especially in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
Mediterranean and its three principal peninsulas, and eastwards
to West Asia<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a>."</p>

<p>The theory of an African cradle for the dolichocephalic
Mediterranean type does not lack supporters, but when, relying
on the undeniable presence of brachycephals, some
writers would derive the Alpine type from the same area, the
larger aspect of continental migrations appears to be overlooked
(see pp. 451-2 below). To constitute a distinct race, says Zaborowski,
a wide geographical area is needed, such as is presented
by both shores of the Mediterranean "with the whole of North
Africa including the Sahara, which was till lately still thickly
peopled<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a>." Then to the question by whom has this North
African and Mediterranean region been inhabited since quaternary
times, he answers "by the ancestors of our Libyans,
Egyptians, Pelasgians, Iberians"; and after rejecting the
Asiatic theory, he elsewhere arrives at "the grand generalisation
that the whole of North Africa, connected by land with
Europe in the Quaternary epoch, formed part of the geographical
area of the ancient white race, of which the Egyptians,
so far from being the parent stem, would appear to be merely
a branch<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early European
and Mauretanian
types.</div>

<p>Coming to details, Bertholon<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a>, from the human remains
found by Carton at Bulla-Regia, determined for Tunisia and
surrounding lands two main long-headed types,
one like the Neandertal (occurring both in
Khumeria, and in the stations abounding in
palaeoliths), the other like the later Cro-Magnon dolmen-builders,
whom De Quatrefages had already identified with
the tall, long-headed, fair, and even blue-eyed Berbers still
met in various parts of Mauretania, and formerly represented
in the Canary Islands<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a>. Bertholon agrees with Collignon
that the Mauretanian megalith-builders are of the same race
as those of Europe, and besides the two long-headed races<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
describes (1) a short round-headed type in Gerba Island and
East Tunisia<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> representing the Libyans proper, and (2) a
blond type of the Sahel, Khumeria, and other parts, whom
he identifies with the Mazices of Herodotus, with the "Afri,"
whose name has been extended to the whole continent, and
the blond Getulians of the Aures Mountains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Three
Great European
Ethnical Groups.</div>

<p>It has been objected that, as established by de Lapouge
and Ripley, there are three distinct ethnical zones in Europe:&mdash;(1)
Nordic: the tall, fair, long-headed northern
type, commonly identified by the Germans with
the race represented by the osseous remains from
the "Reihengr&auml;ber," <i>i.e.</i> the "Germanic," which the French
call Kymric or Aryan, for which de Lapouge reserves Linn&eacute;'s
<i>Homo europaeus</i>, and to which Ripley applies the term
"Teutonic," because the whole combination of characters
"accords exactly with the descriptions handed down to us by
the ancients. Such were the Goths, Ostrogoths, Visigoths,
Vandals, Lombards, together with the Danes, Norsemen,
Saxons.... History is thus corroborated by natural science."
(2) Mediterranean: the southern zone of short, dark, long-heads,
<i>i.e.</i> the primitive element in Iberia, Italy, South France,
Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia, and Greece, called Iberians by the
English, and identified by many with the Ligurians, Pelasgians,
and allied peoples, grouped together by Ripley as Mediterraneans<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a>.
(3) Alpine: the central zone of short, medium-sized
round-heads with light or chestnut hair, and gray or
hazel eye, de Lapouge's and Ripley's <i>Homo alpinus</i>, the Kelts
or Kelto-Slavs of the French, the Ligurians or Arvernians
of Beddoe and other English writers. Here belong the tall
Armenoids, the Armenians being descendants of the Hittites.</p>

<p>The question is, Can all these have come from North<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
Africa? We have seen that this region has yielded the
remains of one round-headed and two long-headed prehistoric
types. Henri Malbot pointed out that, as far back as we can
go, we meet the two quite distinct long-headed Berber types,
and he holds that this racial duality is proved by the megalithic
tombs (dolmens) of Roknia between Jemmapes and Guelma,
possibly some 4000 or 5000 years old. The remains here
found by L. L. C. Faidherbe belong to two different races,
both dolichocephalic, but one tall, with prominent zygomatic
arches and very strong nasal spine (it reads almost like the
description of a brawny Caledonian), the other short, with
well-balanced skull and small nasal spine<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a>. The earliest
(Egyptian) records refer to brown and blond populations
living in North Africa some 5000 years ago, and it has been
claimed that the raw materials, so to say, were here to hand
both of the fair northern and dark southern European long-heads.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Guanches&mdash;Types
and Affinities.</div>

<p>These different races were represented even amongst the
extinct Guanches of the Canary Islands, as shown by a study
of the 52 heads procured in 1894 by H. Meyer
from caves in the archipelago<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a>. Three distinct
types are determined: (1) Guanche, akin to the
Cro-Magnon, tall (5 ft. 8 in. to 6 ft. 2 in.), robust, dolicho (78),
low, broad face; large eyes, rather short nose; fair, reddish
or light chestnut hair; skin and eyes light; ranged throughout
the islands, but centred chiefly in Tenerife; (2) "<i>Semitic</i>,"
short (5 ft. 4 or 5 in.), slim, narrow mesocephalic head (81),
narrow, long face, black hair, light brown skin, dark eyes;
range, Grand Canary, Palma, and Hierro; (3) <i>Armenoid</i>, akin
to von Luschan's pre-Semitic of Asia Minor; shorter than
1 and 2; very short, broad, and high skull (hyperbrachy, 84);
hair, skin and eyes very probably of the West Asiatic brunette
type; range, mainly in Gomera, but met everywhere. Many
of the skulls had been trepanned, and these are brought into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
direct association with the full-blood Berbers of the Aures
Mts. in Algeria, who still practise trepanning for wounds,
headaches, and other reasons. This type is scarcely to
be distinguished from Lapouge's short brown <i>Homo alpinus</i>,
which dates from the Stone Ages, and is found in densest
masses in the Central Alpine regions, but the true Armenoids
are differentiated by their taller stature<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of the
European
Brachycephals.</div>

<p>How numerous were the inhabitants of France at that
time may be inferred from the long list of no less than 4000
neolithic stations given for that region by Ph. Salmon. Of
the 688 skulls from those stations measured by him, 57.7 per
cent. are classed as dolicho, 21.2 as brachycephalic, and 21.1
as intermediate. This distinguished palethnologist regards
the intermediates as the result of crossings
between the two others, and of these he thinks
the first arrivals were the round-heads, who
ranged over a vast area between Brittany, the Channel, the
Pyrenees, and the Mediterranean, 60 per cent. of the graves
hitherto studied containing skulls of this type<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a>. Belgium also,
where a mixture of long- and round-heads is found amongst
the men of Furfooz, must be included in this neolithic brachy
domain, which can be traced as far westward as the British
Isles<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a>. Attempts have been made, as indicated above, to
derive these brachycephals, as well as the dolichocephals, from
North Africa, in accordance with the view that the latter
region was the true centre of evolution and of dispersion for
all the main branches of the Caucasic family, but this theory
has few supporters at the present time. Sergi recognised the
Asiatic origin of the neolithic round-heads and regarded them
as "peaceful infiltrations<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a>," forerunners of the great invasions
of the later Metal Ages. Verneau points out<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> that when all
the neolithic stations in which brachycephalic skulls have been
discovered are plotted out on a map of Europe it is easy to
recognise a current running almost directly from east to west.
Moreover towards the west this current divides, being clearly
separated by zones of dolichocephaly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span></p>

<p>Evidence of the presence in early times of tall blond
peoples in Africa, side by side with a short dark population,
and of brachycephals together with dolichocephals, proves that
even in the Stone Age ethnic mixtures had already taken
place, and racial purity&mdash;if indeed it ever existed&mdash;must be
sought for in still remoter periods.</p>

<p>With Sergi's view which traces the neolithic inhabitants
of the northern shores of the Mediterranean (Iberians, Ligurians,
Messapians, Siculi and other Itali, Pelasgians), to North
Africa, most anthropologists agree<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a>. Also that all or most of
these were primarily of a dark (brown), short, dolicho type,
which still persists both in South Europe and North Africa,
and in fact is the race which Ripley properly calls "Mediterranean,"
although in the west they almost certainly ranged
into Brittany and the British Isles. But there are some who
hold that the migration was in the opposite direction, and
derive the North African branch from Europe, rather than the
European branches from Africa. "Anthropologists who have
specially studied the question of the Berbers or Kabyles have
concluded that they are descendants of prehistoric European
invaders who occupied the tracts that suited them best<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a>." In
France the neolithic "Mediterranean type" has been regarded
as lineally descended from palaeolithic predecessors <i>in situ</i><a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a>.
Some would even go further still, and claim Europe as the
place of origin not only of the Mediterranean but also of the
Alpine and Northern branches. "The so-called three races
of Europe are in the main the result of variation from a common
European stock, a variation due to isolation and natural
selection<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary of
Orthodox View.</div>

<p>Without making any claim to finality the following perhaps
best represents orthodox opinion at the present time. It may
be assumed that man evolved somewhere in
Southern Asia in pliocene times, and that the
early groups possessed a tendency to variability
which was directed to some extent by geographical conditions
and became fixed by isolation. The tall fair blue-eyed dolichocephals
(Northern Race) and the short dark dolichocephals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
(Mediterranean Race) may be regarded as two varieties of a
common stock, the former having their area of characterisation
in the steppes north of the plateaus of Eur-Asia, and migrating
eastwards and westwards as the country dried after the last
glacial phase. The southern branch, entering East Africa
from Southern Asia, spread all over North Africa; those in
the east were the archaic Egyptians; to the west were the
Libyans whose descendants are the Berbers; those who crossed
the Mediterranean formed the European branches of the
Mediterranean race. With regard to the third type, while the
central plateaus of Asia were the centre of dispersal for the true
Mongols the western plateaus were the area of characterisation
of a non-Mongolian brachycephalic race, which includes short
and tall varieties. This is the Alpine race, which extends from
the Hindu Kush to Brittany, and formerly spread further
westwards into the British Isles<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Linguistic
Evidence.</div>

<p>The problem of European origins has often in the past
been obscured rather than enlightened by an appeal to linguistics,
but linguistic factors cannot altogether
be ignored. No doubt the earliest populations
of the Mediterranean shores during the Stone
Age spoke non-Aryan languages, but it is only here and there
that traces&mdash;mostly indecipherable&mdash;can be discovered. On
the African side we have the Berber language still in its full
vigour; and apparently little changed for thousands of years.
But in Europe the primitive tongues have everywhere been
swept away by the Aryan (Hellenic, Italic, Keltic) except in
the region of the Pyrenees. In Italy Etruscan is the only
language which can with safety be called non-Aryan<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a>, though
the place of Ligurian is still under dispute<a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a>. Of Pelasgian, nothing
survives except the statement of Herodotus, a dangerous
guide in this matter, that it was a barbaric tongue like the
peoples themselves<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a>, but Ridgeway considers it Indo-European<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a>.
Further east, in Asia Minor, neither Karian inscriptions and
glosses nor occasional Lydian<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> and Mysian glosses afford any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>

Lycian leaves its position indeterminate<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> and the Cretan script
is still undeciphered<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Basques.</div>

<p>But in Iberia besides the Iberian inscriptions, which, so
far, remain indecipherable<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a>, there survives the Basque of the
western Pyrenees, which beyond question represents a form
of speech which was current in the peninsula in pre-Aryan
times, and on the assumption of a common origin of the
populations on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar might be
expected to show traces of kinship with Berber.
In a posthumous work on this subject<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a>, the
eminent philologist G. von der Gabelenz goes much further
than mere traces, and claims to establish not only phonetic
and verbal resemblances, but structural correspondences, so
that his editor Graf von der Schulenberg was satisfied as to
the relationship of the two languages<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a>. This conclusion has
not, however, met with general acceptance<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> and the affinities
of Basque with Finno-Ugrian cannot be overlooked<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a>. A study
of the physical features of the modern Basques adds complexity
to the problem. Most observers are agreed that a distinct
Basque type exists, and this physical and linguistic singularity
has led to various more or less fanciful theories "connecting
the Basques with every outlandish language and bankrupt
people under the sun<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a>," while G. Herv&eacute;<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> would regard them
as forming by themselves a separate ethnic group, "a fourth
European race." On the other hand Feist<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> has grounds for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
claiming that the Basques are not, in anthropological respects,
essentially different from their Spanish or French neighbours
(p. 357) and Jullian<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> denies them more than a superficial unity.
These apparently conflicting opinions are reconciled by the
conclusions of R. Collignon<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a>, himself one of the best authorities
on the subject. "The physical traits characteristic of the
Basques attach them unquestionably ('indiscutablement') to
the great Hamitic branch of the white races, that is to say,
to the ancient Egyptians and to the various groups commonly
comprised under the collective name of Berbers. Their
brachycephaly, slight as it is, cannot outweigh the aggregate
of the other characters which they present.... It is therefore in
this direction and not amongst Finns or Esthonians that is to
be sought the parent stem of this paradoxical race. It is
North African or European, assuredly not Asiatic." Collignon's
explanation of the Basque type is that it is a sub-species of
the Mediterranean stock evolved by long-continued and complete
isolation, and in-and-in breeding, primarily engendered by
peculiarity of language. The effects of heredity, aided perhaps
by artificial selection, have generated local peculiarities and
have developed them to an extreme<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Iberians.</div>

<p>"The Iberian question," says Rice Holmes, "is the most
complicated and difficult of all the problems of Gallic ethnology<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a>."
From the testimony of Greek and
Roman authors, he draws the following conclusions.
"The name Iberian was probably applied, in the
first instance, only to the people who dwelt between the Ebro
and the Pyrenees. The Iberians once occupied the seaboard
of Gaul between the Rh&ocirc;ne and the Pyrenees; but Ligurians
encroached upon this part of their territory. They also
probably occupied the whole eastern region of the Spanish
peninsula. But," he adds, "we must bear in mind that the
data are both insufficient and uncertain" (p. 288). Later
(p. 301), reviewing the evidence collected by philologists and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
by craniologists, he continues, "it seems to me probable that
the Iberians comprised both people who spoke, or whose
ancestors had spoken, Basque, and people who spoke the
language or languages<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> of the 'Iberian' inscriptions; that to
observers who had not learned to measure skulls and knew
nothing of scientific methods, they appeared to be homogeneous;
that the prevailing type was that which is now called Iberian
and is seen at its purest in Sardinia, Corsica and Sicily; but
that a certain proportion of the whole population may have
been characterised by physical features more or less closely
resembling those which the modern Basques&mdash;French and
Spanish&mdash;possess in common, and which, as MM. Broca and
Collignon tell us, distinguish them from all other European
peoples. Finally it seems probable that the true Iberians
were the people who spoke the languages of the inscriptions,
and that Basque was spoken by a people who occupied Spain
and Southern Gaul before the Iberians arrived. But unless
and until the key to those appalling inscriptions is found, the
problem will never be solved."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Ligurians.</div>

<p>The Ligurian question is still more complex than the
Iberian. For while no facts can be brought forward in direct
contradiction of the assumption that the Iberians
were a short dark dolichocephalic population
occupying the Iberian peninsula in the Stone Age, and
speaking a non-Indo-European language, no such generalisations
with regard to race, physical type, culture, geographical
distribution or language are accepted for the Ligurians. Some,
with Sergi<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a>, consider the Ligurians merely as another branch
of the Mediterranean race. Others, with Zaborowski<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a>, tracing
their presence among the modern inhabitants of Liguria, regard
them as representing the small, dark, brachycephalic race
at its purest. While many who recognise the Ligurians as
belonging to the Mediterranean physical type deny their
affinity with the Iberians. Meyer<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a> considers such a relationship
"not improbable," but D&eacute;chelette<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a> shows that it is
absolutely untenable on archaeological grounds. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
geographical range is equally uncertain. C. Jullian<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> distributes
Ligurians not only over the whole of Gaul, but also throughout
Western Europe, and attributes to them all the glories of
neolithic civilisation; A. Bertrand<a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> thinks that they played
even in Gaul merely a secondary r&ocirc;le; D&eacute;chelette<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a>, on archaeological
evidence, proves that the Ligurian period was <i>par
excellence</i> the Age of Bronze, and Ridgeway<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> identifies it with
the Terramare civilisation. Finally, if we follow Sergi, the
Ligurians must have spoken a non-Indo-European language;
but the most eminent authorities are in the main agreed that
such traces of Ligurian as remain show affinities with Indo-European<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a>.
With regard to their physical type Sergi puts
forward the view that the true Ligurians were like the Iberians,
a section of the long-headed Mediterranean (Afro-European)
stock. From prehistoric stations in the valley of the Po he
collected 59 skulls, all of this type, and all Ligurian; history
and tradition being of accord that before the arrival of the
Kelts this region belonged to the Ligurian domain. "If it
be true that prehistoric Italy was occupied by the Mediterranean
race and by two branches&mdash;Ligurian and Pelasgian&mdash;of
that race, the ancient inhabitants of the Po valley, now
exhumed in those 59 skulls, were Ligurian<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ligurians in
Rhineland and
Italy.</div>

<p>These Ligurians have been traced from their homes on
the Mediterranean into Central Europe. From a study of
the neolithic finds made in Germany, in the district
between Neustadt and Worms, C. Mehlis<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a>
infers that here the first settlers were Ligurians,
who had penetrated up the Rhone and Sa&ocirc;ne into Rhineland.
In the Kircherian Museum in Rome he was surprised to find
a marked analogy between objects from the Riviera and from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
the Rhine; skulls (both dolicho), vases, stone implements,
mill-stones, etc., all alike. Such Ligurian objects, found
everywhere in North Italy, occur in the Rhine lands chiefly
along the left bank of the main stream between Basel and
Mainz, and farther north in the Rheingau at Wiesbaden, and
in the Lahn valley.</p>

<p>The Ligurians may of course have reached the Riviera
round the coast from Illiberis and Iberia; but the same race
is found as the aboriginal element also at the "heel of the
boot," and in fact throughout the whole of Italy and all the
adjacent islands. This point is now firmly established, and
not only Sergi, but several other leading Italian authorities
hold that the early inhabitants of the peninsula and islands
were Ligurians and Pelasgians, whom they look upon as of
the same stock, all of whom came from North Africa, and
that, despite subsequent invasions and crossings, this Mediterranean
stock still persists, especially in the southern provinces
and in the islands&mdash;Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. Hence it
seems more reasonable to bring this aboriginal element straight
from Africa by the stepping stones of Pantellaria, Malta, and
Gozzo (formerly more extensive than at present, and still strewn
with megalithic remains comparable to those of both continents),
than by the roundabout route of Iberia and Southern Gaul<a name="FNanchor_1062_1062" id="FNanchor_1062_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a>.
This is a simple solution of the problem, but it is a question
if it is justifiable to extend the name Ligurian to all that branch
of the Mediterranean race which undoubtedly forms the substratum
of population in Italy and parts of Gaul, ignoring the
presence or absence of "Ligurian" culture or traces of Ligurian
language. D&eacute;chelette<a name="FNanchor_1063_1063" id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a>, relying chiefly upon archaeological
and cultural evidence, sums up as follows: we must consider
the Ligurians as Indo-European tribes, whose area of domination
had its centre, during the Bronze Age, in North Italy,
and the left bank of the Rhone. They were enterprising and
energetic in agriculture and in commerce. Together with
neighbouring peoples of Illyrian stock they engaged in an
indirect but nevertheless regular trade with the northern
regions where amber was collected. Among the Ligurians,
as among the Illyrians and Hyperboreans, a form of heliolatry
was prevalent, popularising the old solar myths in which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
swan appears to have played an important r&ocirc;le. Rice Holmes<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a>
defines more closely their geographical range. "Ligurians
undoubtedly lived in South-eastern Gaul, where they were
found at least as far north as Bellegarde in the department of
the Ain; and, mingled more or less with Iberians, in the
departments of the Gard, H&eacute;rault, Aude and Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es-Orientales.
Most probably they had once occupied the whole
eastern region as far north as the Marne, but had been
submerged by Celts: and perhaps they had also pushed
westward as far as Aquitania." He continues, "Were it
possible to regard the theory of MM. d'Arbois de Jubainville
and Jullian as more than an interesting hypothesis, we should
have to conclude that the Ligurians were simply the long-headed
and short-headed peoples who, reinforced perhaps
from time to time by hordes of immigrants, had inhabited the
whole of Gaul since the Neolithic Age, and of whom the
former, or many of them, were descended from palaeolithic
hunters; in other words that they were the same people who,
after they had been conquered by, or had coalesced with, the
Celtic invaders, called themselves <i>Celtae</i>: but to say which of
them were first known as Ligurians or introduced the Ligurian
language would be utterly hopeless. Finally the little evidence
we possess tends to show that the people called Ligurians,
when they became known to the Greek writers who described
them, were a medley of different races."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sicilian Origins&mdash;Sicani;
Siculi.</div>

<p>For Sicily, with which may practically be included the
south of Italy, we have the conclusions of G. Patroni based
on years of intelligent and patient labours<a name="FNanchor_1065_1065" id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a>. To
Africa this archaeologist traces the palaeolithic
men of the west coast of Sicily and of the caves
near Syracuse explored by Von Adrian<a name="FNanchor_1066_1066" id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a>. "We are forced to
conclude that man arrived in Sicily from Africa at a time
when the isthmus connecting the island with that Continent
still stood above sea-level. He made his appearance about
the same time as the elephant, whose remains are associated
with human bones especially in the west. He followed the
sea coasts, the shells of which offered him sufficient food<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a>."
He was followed by the neolithic man, whose presence has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
been revealed by the researches of Paolo Orsi at the station
of Stentinello on the coast north of Syracuse.</p>

<p>To Orsi is also due the discovery of what he calls the
"Aeneolithic Epoch<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a>," represented by the bronzes of the Girgenti
district. Orsi assigns this culture to the <i>Siculi</i>, and divides it
into three periods, while regarding the neolithic men of Stentinello
as <i>pre-Siculi</i>. But Patroni holds that the aeneolithic
peoples have a right to the historic name of <i>Sicani</i>, and that
the true Siculi were those that arrived from Italy in Orsi's
second period. It seems no longer possible to determine the
true relations of these two peoples, who stand out as distinct
throughout early historic times. They are by many<a name="FNanchor_1069_1069" id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a>
regarded as of one race, although both
(<span class = "greek" title = "Sikanos, Sikelos">&#931;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#962;, &#931;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#955;&#972;&#962;</span>)
are already mentioned in the Odyssey. But the evidence tends to show
that the Sicani represent the oldest element which came direct
from Africa in the Stone Age, while the Siculi were a branch
of the Ligurians driven in the Metal Age from Italy to the
island, which was already occupied by the Sicani, as related
by Dionysius Halicarnassus<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a>. In fact this migration of the
Siculi may be regarded as almost an historical event, which
according to Thucydides took place "about 300 years before
the Hellenes came to Sicily<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a>." The Siculi bore this national
name on the mainland, so that the modern expression "Kingdom
of the Two Sicilies" (the late Kingdom of Naples) has
its justification in the earliest traditions of the people. Later,
both races were merged in one, and the present Sicilian nation
was gradually constituted by further accessions of Phoenician
(Carthaginian), Greek, Roman, Vandal, Arab, Norman, French
and Spanish elements.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sards and
Corsicans.</div>

<p>Very remarkable is the contrast presented by the conditions
prevailing in this ethnical microcosm and those of Sardinia,
inhabited since the Stone Ages by one of the most homogeneous
groups in the world. From the statistics embodied in R. Livi's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span><i>Antropologia Militare</i><a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> the Sards would almost seem to be
cast all in one mould, the great bulk of the
natives having the shortest stature, the brownest
eyes and hair, the longest heads, the swarthiest
complexion of all the Italian populations. "They consequently
form quite a distinct variety amongst the Italian
races, which is natural enough when we remember the seclusion
in which this island has remained for so many ages<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a>." They
seem to have been preserved as if in some natural museum to
show us what the Ligurian branch of the Mediterranean stock
may have been in neolithic times. Yet they were probably
preceded by the microcephalous dwarfish race described by
Sergi as one of the early Mediterranean stocks. Their presence
in Sardinia has now been determined by A. Niceforo
and E. A. Onnis, who find that of about 130 skulls from old
graves thirty have a capacity of only 1150 c.c. or under, while
several living persons range in height from 4 ft. 2 in. to 4 ft. 11 in.
Niceforo agrees with Sergi in bringing this dwarfish race also
from North Africa<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a>.</p>

<p>With remarkable cranial uniformity, similar phenomena
are presented by the Corsicans who show "the same exaggerated
length of face and narrowness of the forehead. The
cephalic index drops from 87 and above in the Alps to about
75 all along the line. Coincidently the colour of hair and eyes
becomes very dark, almost black. The figure is less amply
proportioned, the people become light and rather agile. It is
certain that the stature at the same time falls to an exceedingly
low level: fully 9 inches below the average for Teutonic
Europe," although "the people of Northern Africa, pure
Mediterranean Europeans, are of medium size<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a>."</p>

<p>In the Italian peninsula Sergi holds not only that the
aborigines were exclusively of Ligurian, <i>i.e.</i> Mediterranean
stock, but that this stock still persists in the whole of the
region south of the Tiber, although here and there mixed with
"Aryan" elements. North of that river these elements increase
gradually up to the Italian Alps, and at present are
dominant in the valley of the Po<a name="FNanchor_1076_1076" id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a>. In this way he would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>explain the rising percentage of round-heads in that direction,
the Ligurians being for him, as stated, long-headed, the
"Aryans" round-headed.</p>

<p>Similarly Beddoe, commenting on Livi's statistics, showing
predominance of tall stature, round heads, and fair complexion
in North Italy, infers "that a type, the one we usually call the
Mediterranean, does really predominate in the south, and exists
in a state of comparative purity in Sardinia and Calabria;
while in the north the broad-headed Alpine type is powerful,
but is almost everywhere more or less modified by, or interspersed
with other types&mdash;Germanic, Slavic, or of doubtful
origin&mdash;to which the variations of stature and complexion may
probably be, at least in part, attributed<a name="FNanchor_1077_1077" id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pelasgians.</div>

<p>Similar relations prevail in the Balkan peninsula, where
the Mediterranean stock is represented by the "Pelasgic<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a>"
substratum. Invented, as has been said, for the
purpose of confounding future ethnologists, these
Pelasgians certainly present an extremely difficult racial problem,
the solution of which has hitherto resisted the combined
attacks of ancient and modern students. When Dionysius
tells us bluntly that they were Greeks<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a>, we fancy the question
is settled off-hand, until we find Herodotus describing them a
few hundred years earlier as aliens, rude in speech and usages,
distinctly not Greeks, and in his time here and there (Thrace,
Hellespont) still speaking apparently non-Hellenic dialects<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a>.
Then Homer several centuries still earlier, with his epithet of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
<span class = "greek" title = "dioi">&#948;&#8150;&#959;&#953;</span>, occurring both in the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i><a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a>, exalts them
almost above the level of the Greeks themselves. It would
seem, therefore, almost impossible to discover a key to the
puzzle, one which will also fit in both with Sergi's Mediterranean
theory, and with the results of recent archaeological
researches in the Aegean lands. The following hypothesis is
supported by a certain amount of evidence. If the pre-Mykenaean
culture revealed by Schliemann and others in the Troad,
Mykenae, Argos, Tiryns, by Evans and others in Crete, by
Cesnola in Cyprus, be ascribed to a pre-Hellenic rather than
to a proto-Hellenic people, then the classical references will
explain themselves, while this pre-Hellenic race will be readily
identified with the Pelasgians, as this term is understood by
Sergi.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theory of pre-Hellenic
Pelasgians.</div>

<p>It is, I suppose, universally allowed that Greece really was
peopled before the arrival of the Hellenes, which term is here
to be taken as comprising all the invading tribes from the
north, of which the Achaeans were perhaps the earliest. On
their arrival the Hellenes therefore found the land not only
inhabited, but inhabited by a cultured people more civilised
than themselves, who could thus be identified with Sergi's
Pelasgian branch of the Mediterranean or Afro-European
stock, whom the proto-Hellenes naturally regarded as their
superiors, and whom their first singers also
naturally called <span class = "greek" title = "dioi Pelasgoi">&#948;&#8150;&#959;&#953; &#928;&#949;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#947;&#959;&#943;</span><a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a>. But in the course
of a few centuries<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> these Pelasgians became
Hellenised, all but a few scattered groups, which lagging
behind in the general social progress are now also looked upon
as barbarians, speaking barbaric tongues, and are so described
by contemporary historians. Then these few remnants of a
glorious but forgotten past are also merged in the Hellenic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
stream, and can no longer be distinguished from other Greeks
by contemporary writers. Hence for Dionysius the Pelasgians
are simply Greeks, which in a sense may be true enough.
All the heterogeneous elements have been fused in a single
Hellenic nationality, built upon a rough Pelasgic substratum,
and adorned with all the graces of Hellenic culture.</p>

<p>Now to make good this hypothesis, it is necessary to show,
first, that the Pelasgians were not an obscure tribe, a small
people confined to some remote corner of Hellas, but a widespread
nation diffused over all the land; secondly, that this
nation, as far as can now be determined, presented mental and
other characters answering to those of Sergi's Mediterraneans,
and also such as might be looked for in a race capable of
developing the splendid Aegean culture of pre-Hellenic times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pelasgians and
Mykenaean
civilisation.</div>

<p>On the first point it has been claimed that the Pelasgians
were so widely distributed<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> that the difficulty rather is to
discover a district where their presence was unknown.
They fill the background of Hellenic
origins, and even spread beyond the Hellenic
horizon, to such an extent that there seems little room for any
other people between the Adriatic and the Hellespont. Thus
Ridgeway<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> has brought together a good many passages which
clearly establish their universal range, as well as their occupation
especially of those places where have been found objects
of Mykenaean and pre-Mykenaean culture, such as engraved
gems, pottery, implements, buildings, inscriptions in pictographic
and syllabic scripts. In Crete they had the "great
city of Knossos" in Homer's time<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a>; not only was Mykenae
theirs, but the whole of Peloponnesus took the name of
Pelasgia; the kings of Tiryns were Pelasgians, and Aeschylus
calls Argos a Pelasgian city; an old wall at Athens was
attributed to them, and the people of Attica had from all time
been Pelasgians<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a>. Orchomenus in Boeotia was founded by a
colony from Pelasgiotis in Thessaly; Lesbos also was called
Pelasgia, and Homer knew of Pelasgians in the Troad. Their
settlements are further traced to Egypt, to Rhodes, Cyprus,
Epirus&mdash;where Dodona was their ancient shrine&mdash;and lastly
to various parts of Italy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Aegean
Culture.</div>

<p>Moreover, the Pelasgians were traditionally the civilising
element, who taught people to make bread, to yoke the ox to
the plough, and to measure land. It would appear
from these and other allusions that there
were memories of still earlier aborigines, amongst
whom the Pelasgians appear as a cultured people, introducing
perhaps the arts and industries of the pre-Mykenaean Age.
But the assumption, based on no known data, is unnecessary,
and it seems more reasonable to look on this culture as locally
developed, to some extent under eastern (Egyptian, Babylonian,
Hittite?) influences<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a>. Here it is important to note that the
Pelasgians were credited with a knowledge of letters<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a>, and all
this has been advanced as sufficient confirmation of our second
postulate. Nevertheless it must be acknowledged that the
difficulties are not all overcome by this hypothesis, and the
further question of language divides even its stanchest supporters
into opposing groups, for while Sergi's Mediterraneans
necessarily speak a non-Indo-European language<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a>, Ridgeway's
Pelasgians speak Aeolic Greek<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other Views.</div>

<p>The range and importance of the Pelasgians are most
strictly limited by J. L. Myres<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a>, who thinks that the Alpine
type may even be primitive in the Morea, Mediterranean
man being an intruder from the south
merely fringing the coast and never penetrating inland. The
researches of von Luschan in Lycia support this view<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a>, and
Ripley's map of the present inhabitants of the Balkan peninsula
shows the "Greek contingent closely confined to the sea-coast<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a>."
Ripley, however, though carefully avoiding any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
dragging of "Pelasgians" into the question, assumes a primitive
substratum of Mediterranean type all over Greece. "The
testimony of these ancient Greek crania is perfectly harmonious.
All authorities agree that the ancient Hellenes were decidedly
long-headed, betraying in this respect their affinity to the
Mediterranean Race.... Whether from Attica, from Schliemann's
successive cities excavated upon the site of Troy, or from the
coast of Asia Minor<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a>; at all times from 400 B.C. to the third
century of our era, it would seem proved that the Greeks were
of this dolichocephalic type.... Every characteristic of their
modern descendants and every analogy with the neighbouring
populations, leads us to the conclusion that the classical
Hellenes were distinctly of the Mediterranean racial type,
little different from the Phoenicians, the Romans or the
Iberians<a name="FNanchor_1096_1096" id="FNanchor_1096_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a>." Nevertheless D&ouml;rpfeld<a name="FNanchor_1097_1097" id="FNanchor_1097_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a> claims that there were,
from the first, two races in Greece, a Southern, or Aegean,
and a Northern, who were the Aryan Achaeans of history,
and recent archaeological discoveries certainly support this
view.</p>

<p>Another attempt to solve the Pelasgian problem is that of
E. Meyer<a name="FNanchor_1098_1098" id="FNanchor_1098_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a>. After enumerating the various areas said to have
been occupied by the Pelasgians "<i>ein grosses Urvolk</i>" who
ranged from Asia Minor to Italy, he pricks the bubble by
saying that in reality there were no Pelasgians save in Thessaly,
in the fruitful plain of Peneus, hence called "Pelasgic Argos<a name="FNanchor_1099_1099" id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a>,"
and later Pelasgiotis. They, like the Dorians, invaded Crete
from Thessaly and at the beginning of the first millennium
were defeated and enslaved by the incoming Thessalians.
These are the only true Pelasgians. The other so-called
Pelasgians are the descendants of an eponymous Pelasgos
who in genealogical poetry becomes the ancestor of mankind.
Since the Arcadians were regarded as the earliest of the
indigenous peoples, Pelasgos was made the ancestor of the
Arcadians. The name "Pelasgic Argos" was transferred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
from Thessaly to the Peloponnesian city. Attic Pelasgians
were derived from a mistake of Hecataeus<a name="FNanchor_1100_1100" id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a>. So the legend
grew. The only real Pelasgian problem, concludes Meyer, is
whether the Thessalian Pelasgians were a Greek or pre-Greek
people, and he is inclined to favour the latter view. The
identity of "the most mysterious people of antiquity" is
further obscured by philology, for, as P. Giles points out,
their name appears merely to mean "the people of the sea,"
so that "they do not seem to be in all cases the same stock<a name="FNanchor_1101_1101" id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a>."</p>

<p>Whether we call them Pelasgians or no, there would seem
to be little doubt that the splendours of Aegean civilisation
which have been and still are being gradually revealed by the
researches of British, Italian, American and German archaeologists
are to be attributed to an indigenous people of Mediterranean
type, occupying an area of which Crete was the
centre, from the Stone Age, right through the Bronze Age,
down to the Northern invasions of the second millennium and
the introduction of iron. In range this culture included Greece
with its islands, Cyprus, and Western Anatolia, and its influence
extended westwards to Sicily, Italy, Sardinia and Spain, and
eastwards to Syria and Egypt. Its chief characteristics are
(1) an indigenous script both pictographic and linear, with
possible affinities in Hittite, Cypriote and South-west Anatolian
scripts, but hitherto indecipherable; (2) a characteristic
art attempting "to express an ideal in forms more and more
closely approaching to realities<a name="FNanchor_1102_1102" id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a>," exhibited in frescoes, pottery,
reliefs, sculptures, jewelry etc.; (3) a distinctive architectural
style, and (4) type of tomb, which have no parallels elsewhere.
Excavations at Cnossos go far towards establishing a chronology
for the Aegean area. At the base is an immensely
thick neolithic deposit, above which come pottery and other
objects of Minoan Period I. 1, which are correlated by Petrie
with objects found at Abydos, referred by him to the 1st
Dynasty (4000 <small>B.C.</small>). Minoan Period II. 2 corresponds with
the Egyptian XII Dynasty (2500 <small>B.C.</small>), characteristic Cretan
pottery of this period being found in the Fayum.  Minoan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
Period III. 1 and 2 synchronises with Dynasty XVIII (1600
to 1400 <small>B.C.</small>). Iron begins to be used for weapons after
Period III. 3, and is commonly attributed to incursions from
the north, the Dorian invasion of the Greek authors, about
1000 B.C. which led to the destruction of the palace of Cnossos
and the substitution of "Geometric" for "Mykenaean" art.</p>

<p>Turning to the African branch of the Mediterranean type,

the Mediterranean to Sudan, although since

more in their inner than in their outer characters, without
constituting a single ethnical type. The cranial
forms are variable, though converging, and evidently
to be regarded as very old varieties of
an original stock. The features are also variable, converging
and characteristic, with straight or arched (aquiloid) nose
quite different from the Negro; lips rather thick, but never
everted as in the Negro; hair usually frizzled, not wavy;
beard thin; skin very variable, brown, red-brown, black-brown,
ruddy black, chocolate and coffee-brown, reddish or
yellowish, these variations being due to crossings and the
outward physical conditions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Western
"Moors."</div>

<p>In this assumption Sergi is supported by the analogous
case of the western Berbers between the Senegal and Morocco,
to whom Collignon and Deniker<a name="FNanchor_1104_1104" id="FNanchor_1104_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a> restrict
the term "Moor," as an ethnical name. The
chief groups, which range from the Atlantic
coast east to the camping grounds of the true Tuaregs<a name="FNanchor_1105_1105" id="FNanchor_1105_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a>, are
the Trarsas and Braknas of the Senegal river, and farther
north the Dwa&iuml;sh (Idoesh), Uled-Bella, Uled-Embark, and
Uled-en-Nas&uacute;r. From a study of four of these Moors, who
visited Paris in 1895, it appears that they are not an Arabo-Berber
cross, as commonly supposed, but true Hamites, with
a distinct Negro strain, shown especially in their frizzly hair,
bronze colour, short broad nose, and thickish lips, their general
appearance showing an astonishing likeness to the Bejas,
Afars, Somals, Abyssinians, and other Eastern Hamites.
This is not due to direct descent, and it is more reasonable
to suppose "that at the two extremities of the continent the
same causes have produced the same effects, and that from
the infusion of a certain proportion of black blood in the
Egyptian [eastern] and Berber branches of the Hamites,
there have sprung closely analogous mixed groups<a name="FNanchor_1106_1106" id="FNanchor_1106_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a>." From
the true Negro they are also distinguished by their grave and
dignified bearing, and still more by their far greater intelligence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
Hamitic Type.</div>

<p>Both divisions of the Hamites, continues Sergi, agree
substantially in their bony structure, and thus form a single
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>anthropological group with variable skull&mdash;pentagonoid,
ovoid, ellipsoid, sphenoid, etc., as expressed in
his terminology&mdash;but constant, that is, each
variety recurring in all the branches; face also
variable (tetragonal, ellipsoid, etc.), but similarly identical in
all the branches; profile non-prognathous; eyes dark, straight,
not prominent; nose straight or arched; hair smooth, curly,
long, black or chestnut; beard full, also scant; lips thin or
slightly tumid, never protruding; skin of various brown shades;
stature medium or tall.</p>

<p>Such is the great anthropological division, which was
diffused continuously over the greater part of Africa, and
round the northern shores of the Mediterranean. According
to Stuhlmann<a name="FNanchor_1107_1107" id="FNanchor_1107_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a> it had its origin in South Arabia, if not further
east, and entered Africa in the region of Erythrea. He regards
the Red Sea as offering no obstacle to migrations, but
suggests a possible land connection between the opposite
shores.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foreign
Elements in
Mauretania.</div>

<p>Nothing is more astonishing than the strange persistence
not merely of the Berber type, but of the Berber temperament
and nationality since the Stone Ages, despite the successive
invasions of foreign peoples during the historic period. First
came the Sidonian Phoenicians, founders of Carthage and Utica
probably about 1500 <small>B.C.</small> The Greek occupation of Cyrenaica
(628 <small>B.C.</small>) was followed by the advent of the Romans on the
ruins of the Carthaginian empire. The Romans
have certainly left distinct traces of their presence,
and some of the Aures highlanders still proudly
call themselves <i>Ruman&iacute;ya</i>. These <i>Shaw&iacute;as</i> ("Pastors") form
a numerous group, all claiming Roman descent, and even still
keeping certain Roman and Christian feasts, such as <i>Bu Ini</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> Christmas; <i>Innar</i> or <i>January</i> (New Year's Day); Spring
(Easter), etc. A few Latin words also survive such as <i>urtho</i>
= hortus; <i>kerr&uacute;sh</i> = quercus (evergreen oak); <i>milli</i> = milliarium
(milestone).</p>

<p>After the temporary Vandal occupation came the great Arab
invasions of the seventh and later centuries, and even these
had been preceded by the kindred <i>Ruadites</i>, who had in pre-Moslem
times already reached Mauretania from Arabia. With<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
the Jews, some of whom had also reached Tripolitana before
the New Era, a steady infiltration of Negroes from Sudan,
and the recent French, Spanish, Italian, and Maltese settlers,
we have all the elements that go to make up the cosmopolitan
population of Mauretania.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arab and
Berber Contrasts.</div>

<p>But amid them all the Berbers and the Arabs stand out as
the immensely predominant factors, still distinct despite a
probably common origin in the far distant past
and later interminglings. The Arab remains
above all a nomad herdsman, dwelling in tents,
without house or hamlet, a good stock-breeder, but a bad
husbandman, and that only on compulsion. "The ploughshare
and shame enter hand in hand into the family," says the
national proverb. To find space for his flocks and herds he
continues the destructive work of Carthaginian and Roman,
who ages ago cleared vast wooded tracts for their fleets and
commercial navies, and thus rendered large areas barren and
desolate.</p>

<p>The Berber on the contrary loves the sheltering woodlands;
he is essentially a highlander who carefully tills the
forest glades, settles in permanent homes, and often develops
flourishing industries. Arab society is feudal and theocratic,
ruled by a despotic Sheikh, while the Berber with his <i>Jemaa</i>, or
"Witenagemot," and his <i>Kanun</i> or unwritten code, feels himself
a freeman; and it may well have been this democratic
spirit, inherited by his European descendants, that enabled the
western nations to take the lead in the onward movement of
humanity. The Arab again is a fanatic, ever to be feared,
because he blindly obeys the will of Allah proclaimed by his
prophets, marabouts, and mahdis<a name="FNanchor_1108_1108" id="FNanchor_1108_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a>. But the Berber, a born
sceptic, looks askance at theological dogmas; an unconscious
philosopher, he is far less of a fatalist than his Semitic neighbour,
who associates with Allah countless demons and jins in
the government of the world.</p>

<p>In their physical characters the two races also present some
striking contrasts, the Arab having the regular oval brain-cap
and face of the true Semite, whereas the Berber head is more
angular, less finely moulded, with more prominent cheekbones,
shorter and less aquiline nose, which combined with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
slight degree of sub-nasal prognathism, imparts to the features
coarser and less harmonious outlines. He is at the same time
distinctly taller and more muscular, with less uniformity in the
colour of the eye and the hair, as might be expected from the
numerous elements entering into the constitution of present
Berber populations.</p>

<p>In the social conflict between the Arab and Berber races,
the curious spectacle is presented of two nearly equal elements
(same origin, same religion, same government, same or
analogous tribal groupings, at about the same cultural development)
refusing to amalgamate to any great extent, although
living in the closest proximity for over a thousand years. In
this struggle the Arab seems so far to have had the advantage.
Instances of Berberised Arabs occur, but are extremely rare,
whereas the Berbers have not only everywhere accepted the
Koran, but whole tribes have become assimilated in speech,
costume, and usages to the Semitic intruders. It might therefore
seem as if the Arab must ultimately prevail. But we are
assured by the French observers that in Algeria and Tunisia
appearances are fallacious, however the case may stand in
Morocco and the Sahara. "The Arab," writes Malbot, to
whom I am indebted for some of these details, "an alien in
Mauretania, transported to a soil which does not always suit
him, so far from thriving tends to disappear, whereas the Berber,
especially under the shield of France, becomes more and more
aggressive, and yearly increases in numbers. At present he
forms at least three-fifths of the population in Algeria, and in
Morocco the proportion is greater. He is the race of the
future as of the past<a name="FNanchor_1109_1109" id="FNanchor_1109_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a>."</p>

<p>This however would seem to apply only to the races, not
to their languages, for we are elsewhere told that Arabic is
encroaching steadily on the somewhat ruder Berber dialects<a name="FNanchor_1110_1110" id="FNanchor_1110_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a>.
Considering the enormous space over which they are diffused,
and the thousands of years that some of the groups have ceased
to be in contact, these dialects show remarkably slight divergence
from the long extinct speech from which all have sprung.
Whatever it be called&mdash;Kabyle, Zenatia, Shawia, Tamashek,
Shluh&mdash;the Berber language is still essentially one, and the
likeness between the forms current in Morocco, Algeria, the
Sahara, and the remote Siwah Oasis on the confines of Egypt,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
is much closer, for instance, than between Norse and English
in the sub-Aryan Teutonic group<a name="FNanchor_1111_1111" id="FNanchor_1111_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Tibus.</div>

<p>But when we cross the conventional frontier between the
contiguous Tuareg and Tibu domains in the central Sahara the
divergence is so great that philologists are still
doubtful whether the two languages are even
remotely or are at all connected. Ever since the abandonment
of the generalisation of Lepsius that Hamitic and Negro were
the sole stock languages, the complexity of African linguistic
problems has been growing more and more apparent, and Tibu
is only one among many puzzles, concerning which there is
great discordance of opinion even among the most recent and
competent authorities<a name="FNanchor_1112_1112" id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a>.</p>

<p>The Tibu themselves, apparently direct descendants of the
ancient Garamantes, have their primeval home in the Tibesti
range, <i>i.e.</i> the "Rocky Mountains," whence they take their
name<a name="FNanchor_1113_1113" id="FNanchor_1113_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a>. There are two distinct sections, the Northern <i>Tedas</i>,
a name recalling the <i>Tedamansii</i>, a branch of the Garamantes
located by Ptolemy somewhere between Tripolitana and Phazania
(Fezzan), and the Southern <i>Dazas</i>, through whom the
Tibu merge gradually in the negroid populations of central
Sudan. This intermingling with the blacks dates from remote
times, whence Ptolemy's remark that the Garamantes seemed
rather more "Ethiopians" than Libyans<a name="FNanchor_1114_1114" id="FNanchor_1114_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a>. But there can be
no doubt that the full-blood Tibu, as represented by the
northern section, are mainly Mediterranean, and although the
type of the men is somewhat coarser than that of their Tuareg
neighbours, that of the women is almost the finest in Africa.
"Their women are charming while still in the bloom of youth,
unrivalled amongst their sisters of North Africa for their
physical beauty; pliant and graceful figures<a name="FNanchor_1115_1115" id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span></p>

<p>It is interesting to notice amongst these somewhat secluded
Saharan nomads the slow growth of culture, and the curious
survival of usages which have their explanation in primitive
social conditions. "The Tibu is always distrustful; hence,
meeting a fellow-countryman in the desert he is careful not to
draw near without due precaution. At sight of each other
both generally stop suddenly; then crouching and throwing the
litham over the lower part of the face in Tuareg fashion, they
grasp the inseparable spear in their right and the shanger-mangor,
or bill-hook, in their left. After these preliminaries
they begin to interchange compliments, inquiring after each
other's health and family connections, receiving every answer
with expressions of thanksgiving to Allah. These formalities
usually last some minutes<a name="FNanchor_1116_1116" id="FNanchor_1116_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a>." Obviously all this means nothing
more than a doffing of the hat or a shake-hands amongst more
advanced peoples; but it points to times when every stranger
was a <i>hostis</i>, who later became the <i>hospes</i> (host, guest).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Egyptian
Hamites.</div>

<p>It will be noticed that the Tibu domain, with the now
absolutely impassable Libyan desert<a name="FNanchor_1117_1117" id="FNanchor_1117_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a>, almost completely separates
the Mediterranean branch from the Hamites
proper. Continuity, however, is accorded, both
on the north along the shores of the Mediterranean
to the Nile Delta (Lower Egypt), and on the south through
Darfur and Kordofan to the White Nile, and thence down
the main stream to Upper Egypt, and through Abyssinia,
Galla and Somali lands to the Indian Ocean. Between the
Nile and the east coast the domain of the Hamites stretches
from the equator northwards to Egypt and the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>It appears therefore that Egypt, occupied for many thousands
of years by an admittedly Hamitic people, might have
been reached either from the west by the Mediterranean route,
or down the Nile, or, lastly, it maybe suggested that the Hamites
were specialised in the Nile valley itself. The point is not
easy to decide, because, when appeal is made to the evidence
of the Stone Ages, we find nothing to choose between such
widely separated regions as Somaliland, Upper Egypt, and
Mauretania, all of which have yielded superabundant proofs
of the presence of man for incalculable ages, estimated by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
some palethnologists at several hundred thousand years. In
Egypt the palaeoliths indicate not only extreme antiquity, but
also that the course of civilisation was uninterrupted by any
such crises as have afforded means of chronological classification
in Western Europe. The differences in technique are local
and geographical, not historic. The Neolithic period tells the
same tale, and the use of copper at the beginning of the historic
period only slowly replaced the flint industry, which continued
during the earlier dynasties down to the period of the Middle
Empire and attained a degree of perfection nowhere surpassed.
Prehistoric pottery strengthens the evidence of a slow, gradual
development, the newer forms nowhere jostling out the old,
but co-existing side by side<a name="FNanchor_1118_1118" id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origins.</div>

<p>It might seem therefore that the question of Egyptian
origins was settled by the mere statement of the case, and
that there could be no hesitation in saying that
the Egyptian Hamites were evolved on Egyptian
soil, consequently are the true autochthones in the Nile valley.
Yet there is no ethnological question more hotly discussed than
this of Egyptian origins and culture, for the two seem inseparable.
There are broadly speaking two schools: the African,
whose fundamental views are thus briefly set forth, and the
Asiatic, which brings the Egyptians with all their works from
the neighbouring continent. But, seeing that the Egyptians are
now admitted to be Hamites, that there are no Hamites to
speak of (let it be frankly said, none at all) in Asia, and that
they have for untold ages occupied large tracts of Africa, there
are several members of the Asiatic school who allow that, not
the people themselves, but their culture only came from western
Asia (Mesopotamia). If so, this culture would presumably
have its roots in the delta, which is first reached by the Isthmus
of Suez from Asia, and spread thence, say, from Memphis
up the Nile to Thebes and Upper Egypt, and here arises a
difficulty. For at that time there was no delta<a name="FNanchor_1119_1119" id="FNanchor_1119_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a>, or at least it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
was only in process of formation, a kind of debatable region
between land and water, inhabitable mainly by crocodiles, and
utterly unsuited to become the seat of a culture whose characteristic
features are huge stone monuments, amongst the largest
ever erected by man, and consequently needing solid foundations
on <i>terra firma</i>. It further appears that although
Memphis is very old, Thebes is much older, in other words,
that Egyptian culture began in Upper Egypt, and spread not
up but down the Nile. On the other hand the Egyptians
themselves looked upon the delta as the cradle of their civilisation,
although no traces of material culture have survived,
or could be expected to survive, in such a soil<a name="FNanchor_1120_1120" id="FNanchor_1120_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a>. Moreover it
is not necessary to introduce Asiatic invaders by way of Lower
Egypt. F. Stuhlmann postulates a land connection between
Africa and Arabia, but even without this assumption he regards
the Red Sea as affording no hindrance to early infiltrations<a name="FNanchor_1121_1121" id="FNanchor_1121_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a>.
Flinders Petrie, while rejecting any considerable water transport
for the uncultured prehistoric Egyptians (whom he derives
from Libya), detects a succession of subsequent invasions from
Asia, the dynastic race crossing the Red Sea to the neighbourhood
of Koptos, and Syrian invasions leading to the civilisation
of the Twelfth Dynasty, besides the later Hyksos invasions
of Semito-Babylonian stock<a name="FNanchor_1122_1122" id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theory of
Asiatic Origins.</div>

<p>The theory of Asiatic origins is clearly summed up by
H. H. Johnston<a name="FNanchor_1123_1123" id="FNanchor_1123_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a>. He regards the earliest inhabitants of Egypt
as a dwarfish Negro-like race, not unlike the
Congo Pygmies of to-day (p. 375), with possibly
some trace of Bushman (p. 378), but this population
was displaced more than 15,000 years ago by Mediterranean
man, who may have penetrated as far as Abyssinia,
and may have been linguistically parent of the Fulah<a name="FNanchor_1124_1124" id="FNanchor_1124_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a>.
The Fulah type was displaced by the invasions of the
Hamites and the Libyans or Berbers. "The Hamites were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
no doubt of common origin, linguistically and racially, with the
Semites, and perhaps originated in that great breeding ground
of conquering peoples, South-west Asia. They preceded the
Semites, and (we may suppose) after a long stay and concentration
in Mesopotamia invaded and colonised Arabia,
Southern Palestine, Egypt, Abyssinia, Somaliland and North
Africa to its Atlantic shores. The Dynastic Egyptians were
also Hamites in a sense, both linguistically and physically; but
they seem to have attained to a high civilisation in Western
Arabia, to have crossed the Red Sea in vessels, and to have
made their first base on the Egyptian coast near Berenice in
the natural harbour formed by Ras Benas. From here a long,
broad wadi or valley&mdash;then no doubt fertile&mdash;led them to the
Nile in the Thebaid, the first seat of their kingly power<a name="FNanchor_1125_1125" id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a>. The
ancestors of the Dynastic Egyptians may have originated the
great dams and irrigation works in Western Arabia; and such
long struggles with increasing drought may have first broken
them in to the arts of quarrying stone blocks and building with
stone. Over population and increasing drought may have
caused them to migrate across the Red Sea in search of another
home; or their migration may have been partly impelled by the
Semitic hordes from the north, whom we can imagine at this
period&mdash;some 9000 to 10,000 years ago&mdash;pressing southwards
into Arabia and conquering or fusing with the preceding
Hamites; just as these latter, no doubt, at an earlier day, had
wrested Arabia from the domain of the Negroid and Dravidian"
(p. 382).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proto-Egyptian
Type.</div>

<p>That the founding of the First Dynasty was coincident
with a physical change in the population, is proved by the
thousands of skeletons and mummies examined
by Elliot Smith<a name="FNanchor_1126_1126" id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a>, who regards the Pre-dynastic
Egyptians as "probably the nearest approximation
to that anthropological abstraction, a pure race, that
we know of (p. 83)." He describes the type as follows (Chap. <small>IV.</small>).</p>

<p>The Proto-Egyptian (<i>i.e.</i> Pre-dynastic) was a man of small
stature, his mean height, estimated at a little under 5 ft. 5 in.,
in the flesh for men, and almost 5 ft. in the case of women,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
being just about the average for mankind in general, whereas
the modern Egyptian <i>fellah</i> averages about 5 ft. 6 in. He was
of very slender build with indications of poor muscular development.
In fact there is a suggestion of effeminate grace and
frailty about his bones, which is lacking in the more rugged
outlines of the skeletons of his more virile successors. The
hair of the Proto-Egyptian was precisely similar to that of the
brunet South European or Iberian people of the present day.
It was a very dark brown or black colour, wavy or almost
straight and sometimes curly, never "woolly." There can be
no doubt whatever that this dark hair was associated with dark
eyes and a bronzed complexion. Elliot Smith emphatically
endorses Sergi's identification of the ancient Egyptian as
belonging to his Mediterranean Race. "So striking is the
family likeness between the Early Neolithic peoples of the
British Isles and the Mediterranean and the bulk of the population,
both ancient and modern, of Egypt and East Africa,
that a description of the bones of an early Briton might apply
in all essential details to an inhabitant of Somaliland." But he
points out also that there is an equally close relationship linking
the Proto-Egyptians with the populations to the east, from the
Red Sea as far as India, including Semites as well as Hamites.
Rejecting the terms "Mediterranean" or "Hamite" as inadequate
he would classify his Mediterranean-Hamite-Semite
group as the "Brown Race<a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a>."</p>

<p>A most fortunate combination of circumstances afforded
Elliot Smith an opportunity for determining the ethnic
affinities of the Egyptian people.</p>

<p>The Hearst Expedition of the University of California,
under the direction of G. A. Reisner, was occupied from 1901
onwards with excavations at Naga-ed-D&ecirc;r in the Thebaid,
where a cemetery, excavated by A. M. Lythgoe, contained
well-preserved bodies and skeletons of the earliest known
Pre-dynastic period. Close by was a series of graves of the
First and Second Dynasties; a few hundred yards away tombs
of the Second to the Fifth Dynasties (examined by A. C. Mace),
with a large number of tombs ranging from the time of the
Sixth Dynasty to the Twelfth. "Thus there was provided a
chronologically unbroken series of human remains representing
every epoch in the history of Upper Egypt from prehistoric
times, roughly estimated at 4000 <small>B.C.</small>, up till the close of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
Middle Empire, more than two thousand years later." To
complete the story Coptic (Christian Egyptian) graves of the
fifth and sixth centuries were discovered on the same site.</p>

<p>"The study of this extraordinarily complete series of
human remains, providing in a manner such as no other site
has ever done the materials for the reconstruction of the racial
history of one spot during more than forty-five centuries, made
it abundantly clear that the people whose remains were buried
just before the introduction of Isl&acirc;m into Egypt were of the
same flesh and blood as their forerunners in the same locality
before the dawn of history. And nine years' experience in
the Anatomical Department of the School of Medicine in
Cairo," continues Elliot Smith, "has left me in no doubt that
the bulk of the present population in Egypt conforms to
precisely the same racial type, which has thus been dominant
in the northern portion of the Valley of the Nile for sixty
centuries<a name="FNanchor_1128_1128" id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Armenoid Type.</div>

<p>As early as the Second Dynasty certain alien traits began
to appear, which became comparatively common in the Sixth
to Twelfth series. The non-Egyptian characters
are observable in remains from numerous sites
excavated by Flinders Petrie in Lower and Middle Egypt, and
are particularly marked in the cemetery round the Giza
Pyramids (excavated by the Hearst Expedition, 1903), containing
remains of more than five hundred individuals, who
had lived at the time of the Pyramid-builders; they are therefore
referred to by Elliot Smith as "Giza traits," and attributed
to Armenoid influence. Soon after the amalgamation of the
Egyptian kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt by Menes
(Mena), consequent perhaps upon the discovery of copper and
the invention of metal implements<a name="FNanchor_1129_1129" id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a>, expeditions were sent
beyond the frontiers of the United Kingdom to obtain copper
ore, wood and other objects. Even in the times of the First
Dynasty the Egyptians began the exploitation of the mines
in the Sinai Peninsula for copper ore. It is claimed by Meyer<a name="FNanchor_1130_1130" id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a>
that Palestine and the Phoenician coast were Egyptian dependencies,
and there is ample evidence that there was intimate
intercourse between Egypt and Palestine as far north as the
Lebanons before the end of the Third Dynasty. From this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
time forward the physical characters of the people of Lower
Egypt show the results of foreign admixture, and present
marked features of contrast to the pure type of Upper Egypt.
The curious blending of characters suggests that the process
of racial admixture took place in Syria rather than in Egypt
itself<a name="FNanchor_1131_1131" id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a>. The alien type is best shown in the Giza necropolis,
and its representatives may be regarded as the builders and
guardians of the Pyramids. The stature is about the same as
that of the Proto-Egyptians, possibly rather lower, but they
were built on far sturdier lines, their bones being more massive,
with well-developed muscular ridges and impressions, and none
of the effeminacy or infantilism of the prehistoric skeletons.
The brain-case has greater capacity with no trace of the meagre
ill-filled character exhibited by the latter. Characteristic
peculiarities were the "Grecian profile" and a jaw closely
resembling those of the round-headed Alpine races.</p>

<p>These "Giza traits" were not a local development, for
they have been noted in all parts of Palestine and Asia Minor,
and abundantly in Persia and Afghanistan. They occur in
the Punjab but are absent from India, having an area of
greatest concentration in the neighbourhood of the Pamirs;
while in a westerly direction, besides being sporadically
scattered over North Africa, they are recognised again in the
extinct Guanches of the Canary Islands. From these considerations
Elliot Smith shapes the following "working
hypothesis."</p>

<p>"The Egyptians, Arabs and Sumerians may have been
kinsmen of the Brown Race, each diversely specialized by
long residence in its own domain; and in Pre-dynastic times,
before the wider usefulness of copper as a military instrument
of tremendous power was realized, the Middle Pre-dynastic
phase of culture became diffused far and wide throughout
Arabia and Sumer. Then came the awakening to the knowledge
of the supremacy which the possession of metal weapons
conferred upon those who wielded them in combat against
those not so armed. Upper Egypt vanquished Lower Egypt
in virtue of this knowledge and the possession of such weapons.
The United Kingdom pushed its way into Syria to obtain
wood and ore, and incidentally taught the Arabs the value of
metal weapons. The Arabs thereby obtained the supremacy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
over the Armenoids of Northern Syria, and the hybrid race
of Semites formed from this blend were able to descend the
Euphrates and vanquish the more cultured Sumerians, because
the latter were without metal implements of war. The non-Semitic
Armenoids of Asia Minor carried the new knowledge
into Europe<a name="FNanchor_1132_1132" id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Asiatic influence
on Egyptian
Culture.</div>

<p>This hypothesis might explain some of the difficult problems
connecting Egypt and Babylonia<a name="FNanchor_1133_1133" id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a>. The non-Asiatic
origin of the Egyptian people appears to be
indicated by recent excavations, but, as mentioned
above, there are still many who hold that Egyptian
culture and civilisation were derived mainly, if not
wholly, from Asiatic (probably Sumerian) sources. The Semitic
elements existing in the ancient Egyptian language, certain
resemblances between names of Sumerian and Egyptian gods,
and the similarity of hieroglyphic characters to the Sumerian
system of writing have been cited as proofs of the dependence
of the one culture upon the other; while the introduction of
the knowledge of metals, metal-working and the crafts of
brick-making and tomb construction have, together with the
bulbous mace-head, cylinder-seal and domesticated animals
and plants<a name="FNanchor_1134_1134" id="FNanchor_1134_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a>, been traced to Babylonia.</p>

<p>But the excavations of Reisner at Naga-ed-D&ecirc;r and those
of Naville at Abydos (1909-10) appear to place the indigenous
development of Egyptian culture beyond question. Reisner's
conclusions<a name="FNanchor_1135_1135" id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> are that there was no sudden break of continuity
between the neolithic and early dynastic cultures of Egypt.
No essential change took place in the Egyptian conception
of life after death, or in the rites and practices accompanying
interment. The most noticeable changes, in the character of
the pottery and household vessels, in the materials for tools
and weapons and the introduction of writing, were all gradually
introduced, and one period fades into another without any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
strongly marked line of division between them. Egypt no
doubt had trading relations with surrounding countries.
Egyptians and Babylonians must have met in the markets of
Syria, and in the tents of Bedouin chiefs. Still, as Meyer
points out, far from Egypt taking over a ready-made civilisation
from Babylonia, Egypt, as regards cultural influence, was
the giver not the receiver<a name="FNanchor_1136_1136" id="FNanchor_1136_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Negroid
Mixture.</div>

<p>One more alien element in Egypt remains to be discussed.
Most writers on Egyptian ethnology detect a Negro or at
least Negroid element in the Caucasoid population,
and although usually assigning priority to
the Negro, assume the co-existence of the two
races from time immemorial to the present day. Measurements
on more than 1000 individuals were made by C. S. Myers,
and these are his conclusions. "There is no anthropometric
(despite the historic) evidence that the population of Egypt,
past or present, is composed of several different races. Our
new anthropometric data favour the view which regards the
Egyptians always as a homogeneous people, who have varied
now towards Caucasian, now towards negroid characters
(according to environment), showing such close anthropometric
affinity to Libyan, Arabian and like neighbouring peoples,
showing such variability and possibly such power of absorption,
that from the anthropometric standpoint no evidence is obtainable
that the modern Egyptians have been appreciably affected
by other than sporadic Sudanese admixture<a name="FNanchor_1137_1137" id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Fulah.</div>

<p>It was seen above (Chap. III.) that non-Negro elements
are found throughout the Sudan from Senegal nearly to Darfur,
nowhere forming the whole of the population,
but nearly always the dominant native race.
These are the Fulah (Fula, Fulbe or Fulani), whose ethnic
affinities have given rise to an enormous amount of speculation.
Their linguistic peculiarity had led many ethnologists to regard
them as the descendants of the first white colonists of North
Africa, "Caucasoid invaders," 15,000 years ago, prior to Hamitic
intrusions from the east<a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a>. Thus would be explained the fact
that their language betrays absolutely no structural affinity
with Semitic or Libyo-Hamitic groups, or with any other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
speech families outside Africa, though offering faint resemblances
in structure with the Lesghian<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> speech of the Caucasus
and the Dravidian tongues of Baluchistan and India. Physically
there seems to be nothing to differentiate them from
other blends<a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a> of Hamite-Negro. The physical type of the
pure-bred Fulah H. H. Johnston describes as follows: "Tall
of stature (but not gigantic, like the Nilote and South-east
Sudanese), olive-skinned or even a pale yellow; well-proportioned,
with delicate hands and feet, without steatopygy,
with long, oval face, big nose (in men), straight nose in women
(nose finely cut, like that of the Caucasian), eyes large and
"melting," with an Egyptian look about them, head-hair
long, black, kinky or ringlety, never quite straight<a name="FNanchor_1141_1141" id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a>." They
were at first a quiet people, herdsmen and shepherds
with a high and intricate type of pagan religion which still
survives in parts of Nigeria. But large numbers of them
became converted to Islam from the twelfth century onwards
and gained some knowledge of the world outside Africa by
their pilgrimages to Mecca. At the end of the eighteenth
and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries an uprise of
Muhammadan fanaticism and a proud consciousness of their
racial superiority to the mere Negro armed them as an aristocracy
to wrest political control of all Nigeria from the hands
of Negro rulers or the decaying power of Tuareg and Songhai.
This race was all unconsciously carrying on the Caucasian
invasion and penetration of Africa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other Eastern
Hamites&mdash;Bejas&mdash;Somals.</div>

<p>A less controversial problem is presented by the Eastern
Hamites, who form a continuous chain of dark Caucasic
peoples from the Mediterranean to the equator,
and whose ethnical unity is now established by
Sergi on anatomical grounds<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a>. Bordering on
Upper Egypt, and extending thence to the foot of the
Abyssinian plateau, is the Beja section, whose chief divisions&mdash;Ababdeh,
Hadendoa, Bisharin, Beni Amer&mdash;have from the
earliest times occupied the whole region between the Nile and
the Red Sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span></p>

<p>C. G. Seligman has analysed the physical and cultural
characters of the Beja tribes (<i>Bisharin</i>, <i>Hadendoa</i> and <i>Beni
Amer</i>), the <i>Barabra</i>, nomad Arabs (such as the <i>Kababish</i> and
<i>Kawahla</i>), Nilotes (<i>Shilluk, Dinka, Nuer</i>) and half-Hamites
(<i>Ba-Hima, Masai</i>), in an attempt by eliminating the Negro
and Semitic elements to deduce the main features which may
be held to indicate Hamitic influence. He regards the <i>Beni
Amer</i> as approximating most closely to the original <i>Beja</i> type
which he thus describes. "Summarizing their physical characteristics
it may be said that they are moderately short,
slightly built men, with reddish-brown or brown skins in which
a greater or less tinge of black is present, while in some cases
the skin is definitely darker and presents some shade of brown-black.
The hair is usually curly, in some instances it certainly
might be described as wavy, but the method of hair dressing
adopted tends to make difficult an exact description of its
condition. Often, as is everywhere common amongst wearers
of turbans, the head is shaved.... The face is usually long and
oval, or approaching the oval in shape, the jaw is often lightly
built, which with the presence of a rather pointed chin may
tend to make the upper part of the face appear disproportionately
broad. The nose is well shaped and thoroughly Caucasian
in type and form<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a>." Among the Hadendoa the "Armenoid"
or so-called "Jewish" nose is not uncommon. Seligman
draws attention to the close resemblance between the <i>Beja</i>
type and that of the ancient Egyptians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Somal
Genealogies.</div>

<p>Through the Afars (Dan&aacute;kil) of the arid coastlands between
Abyssinia and the sea, the Bejas are connected with the numerous
Hamitic populations of the Somali and
Galla lands. For the term "Somal," which is
quite recent and of course unknown to the
natives, H. M. Abud<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> suggests an interesting and plausible
explanation. Being a hospitable people, and milk their staple
food, "the first word a stranger would hear on visiting their
kraals would be 'S&oacute; m&aacute;l,' <i>i.e.</i> 'Go and bring milk.'" Strangers
may have named them from this circumstance, and other
tribal names may certainly be traced to more improbable
sources.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span></p>

<p>The natives hold that two races inhabit the land: (1) <span class="smcap">Asha</span>,
true Somals, of whom there are two great divisions, <i>D&aacute;r&oacute;d</i>
and <i>Ish&aacute;k</i>, both claiming descent from certain noble Arab
families, though no longer of Arab speech; (2) <span class="smcap">H&aacute;w&iacute;ya</span>, who
are not counted by the others as true Somals, but only "pagans,"
and also comprise two main branches, <i>Aysa</i> and <i>Gadabursi</i>.
In the national genealogies collected by Abud and Cox, many
of the mythical heroes are buried at or near Meit, which may
thus be termed the cradle of the Somal race. From this
point they spread in all directions, the D&aacute;r&oacute;ds pushing south
and driving the Galla beyond the Webbe Shebel, and till
lately raiding them as far as the Tana river. It should be
noticed that these genealogical tables are far from complete,
for they exclude most of the southern sections, notably the
<i>Rahanw&iacute;n</i> who have a very wide range on both sides of the Jub.</p>

<p>In the statements made by the natives about true Somals
and "pagans," race and religion are confused, and the distinction
between Asha and H&aacute;w&iacute;ya is merely one between Moslem and
infidel. The latter are probably of much purer stock than the
former, whose very genealogies testify to interminglings of
the Moslem Arab intruders with the heathen aborigines.</p>

<p>Despite their dark colour C. Keller<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> has no difficulty in
regarding the Somali as members of the "Caucasic Race."
The Semitic type crops out decidedly in several groups, and
they are generally speaking of fine physique, well grown, with
proud bearing and often with classic profile, though the type
is very variable owing to Arab and Negro grafts on the
Hamitic stock. The hair is never woolly, but, like that of
the Beja, ringlety and less thick than the Abyssinian and
Galla, sometimes even quite straight. The forehead is finely
rounded and prominent, eye moderately large and rather
deep-set, nose straight, but also snub and aquiline, mouth
regular, lips not too thick, head sub-dolichocephalic.</p>

<p>Great attention has been paid to all these Eastern Hamitic
peoples by Ph. Paulitschke<a name="FNanchor_1146_1146" id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a>, who regards the Galla as both
intellectually and morally superior to the Somals and Afars,
the chief reason being that the baneful influences exercised by
the Arabs and Abyssinians affect to a far greater extent the
two latter than the former group.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Galla.</div>

<p>The Galla appear to have reached the African coast before
the Dan&aacute;kil and Somali, but were driven south-east by pressure
from the latter, leaving Galla remnants as serfs
among the southern Somali, while the presence
of servile negroid tribes among the Galla gives proof of an
earlier population which they partially displaced. Subsequent
pressure from the Masai on the south forced the Galla into
contact with the Dan&aacute;kil, and a branch penetrating inland
established themselves on the north and east of Victoria
Nyanza, where they are known to-day as the Ba-Hima, Wa-Tusi,
Wa-Ruanda and kindred tribes, which have been described
on p. 91.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Masai.</div>

<p>The Masai, the terror of their neighbours, are a mixture
of Galla and Nilotic Negro, producing what has been described
as the finest type in Africa. The build is slender
and the height often over six feet, the face is
well formed, with straight nose and finely cut nostrils, the hair
is usually frizzly, and the skin dark or reddish brown. They
are purely pastoral, possessing enormous herds of cattle in
which they take great pride, but they are chiefly remarkable
for their military organisation which was hardly surpassed by
that of the Zulu. They have everywhere found in the agricultural
peoples an easy prey, and until the reduction of their
wealth by rinderpest (since 1891) and the restraining influence
of the white man, the Masai were regarded as an ever-dreaded
scourge by all the less warlike inhabitants of Eastern Africa<a name="FNanchor_1147_1147" id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Abyssinian
Hamites:
Religion.</div>

<p>Amongst the Abyssinian Hamites we find the strangest
interminglings of primitive and more advanced religious ideas.
On a seething mass of African heathendom, already in pre-historic
times affected by early Semitic ideas introduced
by the Himyarites from South Arabia, was
somewhat suddenly imposed an undeveloped form
of Christianity by the preaching of Frumentius in the fourth
century, with results that cannot be called satisfactory. While
the heterogeneous ethnical elements have been merged in a
composite Abyssinian nationality, the discordant religious ideas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
have never yet been fused in a consistent uniform system.
Hence "Abyssinian Christianity" is a sort of by-word even
amongst the Eastern Churches, while the social institutions are
marked by elementary notions of justice and paradoxical
"shamanistic" practices, interspersed with a few sublime moral
precepts. Many things came as a surprise to the members of the
Rennell Rodd Mission<a name="FNanchor_1148_1148" id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a>, who could not understand such a
strange mixture of savagery and lofty notions in a Christian
community which, for instance, accounted accidental death as
wilful murder. The case is mentioned of a man falling from a
tree on a friend below and killing him. "He was adjudged to
perish at the hands of the bereaved family, in the same manner
as the corpse. But the family refused to sacrifice a second
member, so the culprit escaped." Dreams also are resorted to,
as in the days of the Pharaohs, for detecting crime. A priest is
sent for, and if his prayers and curses fail, a small boy is
drugged and told to dream. "Whatever person he dreams of
is fixed on as the criminal; no further proof is needed.... If
the boy does not dream of the person whom the priest has
determined on as the criminal, he is kept under drugs until he
does what is required of him."</p>

<p>To outsiders society seems to be a strange jumble of an
iron despotism, which forbids the selling of a horse for over
&pound;10 under severe penalties, and a personal freedom or licence,
which allows the labourer to claim his wages after a week's
work and forthwith decamp to spend them, returning next day
or next month as the humour takes him. Yet somehow things
hold together, and a few Semitic immigrants from South Arabia
have for over 2000 years contrived to maintain some kind of
control over the Hamitic aborigines who have always formed
the bulk of the population in Abyssinia<a name="FNanchor_1149_1149" id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a>.</p>

1897, p. 424 sq.) that the North African brown brachycephalics, forming the substratum
in Mauretania, and very pure in Gerba, resemble the European populations
the more they have avoided contact with foreign races. He quotes H. Martin:
"Le type brun qui domine dans la Grande Kabylie du Jurjura ressemble singuli&egrave;rement
en majorit&eacute; au type fran&ccedil;ais brun. Si l'on habillait ces hommes de v&ecirc;tements
europ&eacute;ens, vous ne les distingueriez pas de paysans ou de soldats fran&ccedil;ais." He
compares them especially to the Bretons, and agrees with Martin that "il y a parmi
les Berb&egrave;res bruns des brachyc&eacute;phales; je croirais volontiers que les brachyc&eacute;phales
bruns sont des Ligures. Libyens et Ligures paraissent avoir &eacute;t&eacute; originairement de
la m&ecirc;me race." He thinks the very names are the same:
"<span class = "greek" title = "Libyes">&#923;&#953;&#946;&#973;&#949;&#962;</span> est exactement le m&ecirc;me mot que
<span class = "greek" title = "Ligyes">&#923;&#953;&#947;&#973;&#949;&#962;</span>;

Italy ("Zur Pal&auml;oethnologie Mittel- u. S&uuml;deuropas," in <i>Wiener Anthrop. Ges.</i> 1897,
p. 18), E. A. Freeman holds that they were not only Aryans, but closely akin to the
Romans, speaking "an undeveloped Latin," or "something which did not differ
more widely from Latin than one dialect of Greek differed from another" (<i>The
History of Sicily</i>, etc., <small>I.</small> p. 488). On the Siculi and Sicani, see E. Meyer, <i>Geschichte

"A questi primi abitatori spetta legittimamente il nome di Italici, non a popolazioni
successive [Aryan Umbrians], che avrebbero sloggiato i primi abitanti" (p. 60). The
result is a little confusing, "Italic" being now the accepted name of the Italian
branch of the Aryan linguistic family, and also commonly applied to the Aryans
of this Italic speech, although the word <i>Italia</i> itself may have been indigenous
(Ligurian) and not introduced by the Aryans. It would perhaps be better to regard
"Italia" as a "geographical expression" applicable to all its inhabitants, whatever

of round-headed Aryan Slavs, Teutons, and especially Kelts, while Beddoe seems
to regard the broad-headed Alpine as the original, afterwards modified by intrusive
long-headed types "Germanic, Slavic, or of doubtful origin." Either view would no

nomadic or semi-nomadic pastors; the latter, whom he would call not Hamites at
all, but the Libyan variety of the Mediterranean race, are a white people, with

found the delta still under water. The sea reached almost as far as the Fayum,
and the whole valley, except the Thebais, was a malarious swamp (Herod. <small>II.</small> 4).
Thus late into historic times memories still survived that the delta was of relatively
recent formation, and that the <i>Retu</i> (<i>Romitu</i> of the Pyramid texts, later <i>Rotu</i>,
<i>Romi</i>, etc.) had already developed their social system before the Lower Nile valley
was inhabitable. Hence whether the Nile took 20,000 years (Schweinfurth) or over
70,000, as others hold, to fill in its estuary, the beginning of the Egyptian prehistoric
period must still be set back many millenniums before the new era. "Ce que nous

<div class="sidenote">The Semites&mdash;Cradle,
Origins,
and Migrations.</div>

<p>The Himyaritic immigrants, who still hold sway in a foreign
land, have long ceased to exist as a distinct nationality in their
own country, where they had nevertheless ages ago founded
flourishing empires, centres of one of the very oldest civilisations
of which there is any record. Should future research
confirm the now generally received view that Hamites and
Semites are fundamentally of one stock, a view based both on
physical and linguistic data<a name="FNanchor_1150_1150" id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a>, the cradle of the
Semitic branch will also probably be traced to
South Arabia, and more particularly to that south-western
region known to the ancients as Arabia Felix, <i>i.e.</i> the
Yemen of the Arabs. While Asia and Africa were still partly
separated in the north by a broad marine inlet before the formation
of the Nile delta, easy communication was afforded
between the two continents farther south at the head of the
Gulf of Aden, where they are still almost contiguous. By this
route the primitive Hamito-Semitic populations may have
moved either westwards into Africa, or, as has also been suggested,
eastwards into Asia, where in the course of ages the
Semitic type became specialised.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divisions.</div>

<p>On this assumption South Arabia would necessarily be the
first home of the Semites, who in later times spread thence
north and east. They appear as <i>Babylonians</i>
and <i>Assyrians</i> in Mesopotamia; as <i>Phoenicians</i>
on the Syrian coast; as <i>Arabs</i> on the Nejd steppe; as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
<i>Canaanites</i>, <i>Moabites</i> and others in and about Palestine; as
<i>Amorites</i> (<i>Aramaeans, Syrians</i>) in Syria and Asia Minor.</p>

<p>This is the common view of Semitic origins and early
migrations, but as practically no systematic excavations have
been possible in Arabia, owing to political conditions and the
attitude of the inhabitants, definite archaeological or anthropological
proofs are still lacking. The hypothesis would, however,
seem to harmonise well with all the known conditions.
In the first place is to be considered the very narrow area
occupied by the Semites, both absolutely and relatively to the
domains of the other fundamental ethnical groups. While the
Mongols are found in possession of the greater part of Asia,
and the Hamites with the Mediterraneans are diffused over
the whole of North Africa, South and West Europe since the
Stone Ages, the Semites, excluding later expansions&mdash;Himyarites
to Abyssinia, Phoenicians to the shores of the Mediterranean,
Moslem Arabs to Africa, Irania, and Transoxiana&mdash;have
always been confined to the south-west corner of Asia,
comprising very little more than the Arabian Peninsula, Mesopotamia,
Syria, and (doubtfully) parts of Asia Minor. Moreover
the whole mental outlook of the Semites, their mode of
thought, their religion and organisation, indicate their derivation
from a desert people; while in Arabia are found at the
present time the purest examples not only of Semitic type, but
also of Semitic speech<a name="FNanchor_1151_1151" id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a>. Their early history, however, as
pointed out above, still awaits the spade of the archaeologist,
and the earliest migrations that can be definitely traced are in
the form of invasions of already established states<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Semitic
Migrations.</div>

<p>The first great wave of Semitic migration from Arabia is
placed in the fourth millennium <small>B.C.</small>, 3500 to 2500 or earlier; it
affected Babylonia and probably Syria and Palestine,
judging from the Palestinian place-names
belonging to this "Babylonian-Semitic" period,
and the close connection between Palestine and Babylonia in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
culture and in religious ideas, indicating prehistoric relationship<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a>.
A second wave, Winckler's Canaanitic or Amoritic
migration, followed in the third millennium, covering Babylonia,
laying the foundations of the Assyrian Empire, invading Syria
and Palestine (Phoenicians, Amorites) and possibly later Egypt
(<i>Hyksos</i>). A third wave, the Aramaean, which spread over
Babylonia, Mesopotamia and Syria in the second millennium,
was preceded by the swarming into Syria from the desert of
the Khabiri (Habiru) or Hebrews (Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites
and Israelites among others). From the same area
the Suti pressed into Babylonia about 1100, followed by another
branch, the Chaldeans from Eastern Arabia.</p>

<p>These are but a few of the earlier waves of migration from
the south of which traces can be detected in Western Asia.
Of all invasions from the north, that of the Hittites is the most
important and the most confusing. The Hittites appear to have
moved south from Cappadocia about 2000 <small>B.C.</small>, and they are
found warring against Babylonia in the eighteenth century. A
Hittite dynasty flourished at Mittanni 1420-1411 and in the
fourteenth and thirteenth centuries they conquered and largely
occupied Syria<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a>. Invasions of Phrygians and Philistines from
the west followed the breaking up of the Hittite Empire. The
last great Semitic migration was the most widespread of all.
"It issued, like its predecessors, along the whole margin of the
desert, and in the course of a century had flooded not only
Syria and Egypt, but all North Africa and Spain; it had
occupied Sicily, raided Constance, and in France was only
checked at Poitiers in 732. Eastward it flooded Persia,
founded an empire in India, and carried war and commerce
by sea past Singapore<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a>."</p>

<p>"Thus Western Asia has been swept times and again,
almost without number, by conquering hordes and the no less
severe ethnical disturbances of peaceful infiltrations converging
from every point of the compass in turn....  How, then, is it
possible to learn anything today from the contents of this
cauldron, filled with such an assortment of ingredients and still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
seething from the effects of the disturbance incidental to the
harsh mixing of such incompatible elements<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a>?" Some of the
problems must for the present be regarded as insoluble, but
with the evidence provided by archaeologists and anthropologists
an attempt may be made to read the ethnological history in
these obscure regions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Babylonia,
People and
Civilisation.</div>

<p>The earliest Semitic wave was traceable in Babylonia, but,
as seen above, opinions differ as to its origin and date. "At
what period the Semites first invaded Babylonia,
when and where they first attained supremacy,
are not yet matters of history. We find
Semites in the land and in possession of considerable power
almost as early as we can go back<a name="FNanchor_1157_1157" id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a>." The characteristic
Semitic features are clearly marked, and the language is closely
connected with Canaanitic and Assyrian<a name="FNanchor_1158_1158" id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a>. From the monuments
we learn that the Babylonian Semites had full beards
and wore their hair long, contrasting sharply with the shaven
Sumerians, and thus gaining the epithet "the black-headed
ones." In nose and lips, as in dress, they are clearly distinct
from the Sumerian type<a name="FNanchor_1159_1159" id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a>.</p>

<p>When history commences, the inhabitants of Babylonia
were already highly civilised. They lived in towns, containing
great temples, and were organised in distinct classes or occupations,
and possessed much wealth in sheep and cattle, manufactured
goods, gold, silver and copper. Engraving on metals
and precious stones, statuary, architecture, pottery, weaving
and embroidery, all show a high level of workmanship. They
possessed an elaborate and efficient system of writing, extensively
used and widely understood, consisting of a number of
signs, obviously descended from a form of picture writing, but
conventionalised to an extent that usually precludes the recognition
of the original pictures. This writing was made by the
impression of a stylus on blocks or cakes of fine clay while still
quite soft. These "tablets" were sun-dried, but occasionally
baked hard. This cuneiform writing was adopted by, or was
common to, many neighbouring nations, being freely used in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
Elam, Armenia and Northern Mesopotamia as far as Cappadocia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Assyria,
People and
Civilisation.</div>

<p>Assyrian culture was founded upon that of Babylonia, but
the Assyrians appear to have differed from the Babylonians
in character, though not in physical type<a name="FNanchor_1160_1160" id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a>, while
they were closely related in speech. "The
Assyrians differed markedly from the Babylonians
in national character. They were more robust, warlike,
fierce, than the mild industrial people of the south. It is
doubtful if they were much devoted to agriculture or distinguished
for manufactures, arts and crafts. They were essentially
a military folk. The king was a despot at home, but
the general of the army abroad. The whole organisation of
the state was for war. The agriculture was left to serfs or
slaves. The manufactures, weaving at any rate, were done
by women. The guilds of workmen were probably foreigners,
as the merchants mostly were. The great temples and palaces,
walls and moats, were constructed by captives.... For the greater
part of its existence Assyria was the scourge of the nations
and sucked the blood of other races. It lived on the tribute
of subject states, and conquest ever meant added tribute in all
necessaries and luxuries of life, beside an annual demand for
men and horses, cattle and sheep, grain and wool to supply the
needs of the army and the city<a name="FNanchor_1161_1161" id="FNanchor_1161_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a>."</p>

<p>The early history of Syria and Palestine is by no means
clear, although much light has been shed in recent years by the
excavations of R. A. S. Macalister at Gezer<a name="FNanchor_1162_1162" id="FNanchor_1162_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a>,
where remains were found of a pre-Semitic race,
of Ernst Sellin at Tell Ta'anek and Jericho<a name="FNanchor_1163_1163" id="FNanchor_1163_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a>, and
the labours of the <i>Deutscher Pal&auml;stina-Verein</i> and
especially G. Schumacher at Megiddo<a name="FNanchor_1164_1164" id="FNanchor_1164_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a>. Caves
apparently occupied by man in the Neolithic period were discovered
at Gezer, and are dated at about 3500 to 3000 <span class="smcap">B.C.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span></span>
from their position below layers in which Egyptian scarabs
appear. Fragments of bones give indications of the physical
type. None of the individuals exceeded 5 ft. 7 inches (1.702 m.)
in height, and most were under 5 ft. 4 inches (1.626 m.). They
were muscular, with elongated crania and thick heavy skull-bones.
From their physical characters it could be clearly seen
that they did not belong to the Semitic race. They burned
their dead, a non-Semitic custom, a cave being fitted up as a
crematorium, with a chimney cut up through the solid rock to
secure a good draught<a name="FNanchor_1165_1165" id="FNanchor_1165_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a>.</p>

<p>The first great influx of Semitic nomads is conjectured to
have reached Babylonia, not from the south, but from the
north-west, after traversing the Syrian coast lands. They left
colonists behind them in this region, who afterwards as the
Amurru (Amorites) pressed on in their turn into Babylonia and

<p>The second great wave of Semitic migration appears to
have included the Phoenicians<a name="FNanchor_1167_1167" id="FNanchor_1167_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a>, so called by the Greeks, though
they called themselves Canaanites and their land Canaan<a name="FNanchor_1168_1168" id="FNanchor_1168_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a>, and
are referred to in the Old Testament, as in inscriptions at
Tyre, as "Sidonians." They themselves had a tradition that
their early home was on the Persian Gulf, a view held by
Theodore Bent and others<a name="FNanchor_1169_1169" id="FNanchor_1169_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a>, and recent discoveries emphasise
the close cultural (not necessarily racial) connection between
Palestine and Babylonia<a name="FNanchor_1170_1170" id="FNanchor_1170_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a>.</p>

<p>The weakening of Egyptian hold upon Palestine about the
fourteenth century <small>B.C.</small> encouraged incursions of restless Habiru
(Habiri) from the Syrian deserts, commonly identified with the
Hebrews, and invasions of Hittites from the north. In the
thirteenth century Egypt recovered Palestine, leaving the
Hittites in possession of Syria. About this time the coast was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
invaded by Levantines, including the Purasati, in whom may
perhaps be recognised the Philistines, who gave their name to
Palestine<a name="FNanchor_1171_1171" id="FNanchor_1171_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Jews.</div>

<p>With the Hebrew or Israelitish inhabitants of south Syria
(Canaan, Palestine, "Land of Promise") we are here concerned
only in so far as they form a distinct branch of the Semitic family.
The term "Jews<a name="FNanchor_1172_1172" id="FNanchor_1172_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a>," properly indicating the children
of Judah, fourth son of Jacob, has long been applied
generally to the whole people, who since the disappearance
of the ten northern tribes have been mainly represented by the
tribe of Judah, a remnant of Benjamin and a few Levites, <i>i.e.</i>
the section of the nation which to the number of some 50,000
returned to south Palestine (kingdom of Judaea) after the
Babylonian captivity. These were doubtless later joined by
some of the dispersed northern tribes, who from Jacob's alternative
name were commonly called the "ten tribes of Israel."
But all such Israelites had lost their separate nationality, and
were consequently absorbed in the royal tribe of Judah. Since
the suppression of the various revolts under the Empire, the
Judaei themselves have been a dispersed nationality, and even
before those events numerous settlements had been made in
different parts of the Greek and Roman worlds, as far west as
Tripolitana, and also in Arabia and Abyssinia.</p>

<p>But most of the present communities probably descend from
those of the great dispersion after the fall of Jerusalem (70 <small>A.D.</small>),
increased by considerable accessions of converted "Gentiles,"
for the assumption that they have made few or no converts is
no longer tenable. In exile they have been far more a religious
body than a broken nation, and as such they could not fail under
favourable conditions to spread their teachings, not only
amongst their Christian slaves, but also amongst peoples,
such as the Abyssinian Falashas, of lower culture than themselves.
In pre-Muhammadan times many Arabs of Yemen
and other districts had conformed, and some of their Jewish
kings (Asad Abu-Karib, Dhu Nowas, and others) are still
remembered. About the seventh century all the Khazars&mdash;a
renowned Turki people of the Volga, the Crimea, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
Caspian&mdash;accepted Judaism, though they later conformed to
Russian orthodoxy. The Visigoth persecution of the Spanish
Jews (fifth and sixth centuries) was largely due to their proselytising
zeal, against which, as well as against Jewish and
Christian mixed marriages, numerous papal decrees were issued
in medieval times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diverse
Physical
Types.</div>

<p>To this process of miscegenation is attributed the great
variety of physical features observed amongst the Jews of
different countries<a name="FNanchor_1173_1173" id="FNanchor_1173_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a>, while the distinctly red type cropping out
almost everywhere has been traced by Sayce and
others to primordial interminglings with the
Amorites ("Red People"). "Uniformity only
exists in the books and not in reality. There are Jews with
light and with dark eyes, Jews with straight and with curly
hair, Jews with high and narrow and Jews with short and broad,
noses; their cephalic index oscillates between 65 and 98&mdash;as
far as this index ever oscillates in the <i>genus homo</i><a name="FNanchor_1174_1174" id="FNanchor_1174_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a>!" Nevertheless
certain marked characteristics&mdash;large hooked nose,
prominent watery eyes, thick pendulous and almost everted
under lip, rough frizzly lustreless hair&mdash;are sufficiently general
to be regarded as racial traits.</p>

<p>The race is richly endowed with the most varied qualities,
as shown by the whole tenour of their history. Originally
pure nomads, they became excellent agriculturists after the
settlement in Canaan, and since then they have given proof
of the highest capacity for science, letters, erudition of all
kinds, finance, music, and diplomacy. The reputation of the
medieval Arabs as restorers of learning is largely due to their
wise tolerance of the enlightened Jewish communities in their
midst, and on the other hand Spain and Portugal have never
recovered from the national loss sustained by the expulsion of
the Jews in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. In late
years the persecutions, especially in Russia, have caused a fresh
exodus from the east of Europe, and by the aid of philanthropic
capitalists flourishing agricultural settlements have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
founded in Palestine and Argentina. From statistics taken
in various places up to 1911 the Jewish communities are at
present estimated at about 12,000,000, of whom three-fourths
are in Europe, 380,000 in Africa, 500,000 in Asia, the rest in
America and Australia<a name="FNanchor_1175_1175" id="FNanchor_1175_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hittites.</div>

<p>Intimately associated with all these Aramaic Canaanitic
Semites were a mysterious people who have been identified
with the <i>Hittites</i><a name="FNanchor_1176_1176" id="FNanchor_1176_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a> of Scripture, and to whom this
name has been extended by common consent.
They are also identified with the <i>Kheta</i> of the Egyptian monuments<a name="FNanchor_1177_1177" id="FNanchor_1177_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a>,
as well as with the <i>Khatti</i> of the Assyrian cuneiform
texts. Indeed all these are, without any clear proof, assumed
to be the same people, and to them are ascribed a considerable
number of stones, cylinders, and gems from time to time picked
up at various points between the Middle Euphrates and the
Mediterranean, engraved in a kind of hieroglyphic or rather
pictorial script, which has been variously deciphered according
to the bias or fancy of epigraphists. This simply means that
the "Hittite texts" have not yet been interpreted, and are
likely to remain unexplained, until a clue is found in some bilingual
document, such as the Rosetta Stone, which surrendered
the secret of the Egyptian hieroglyphs. L. Messerschmidt,
editor of a number of Hittite texts<a name="FNanchor_1178_1178" id="FNanchor_1178_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a>, declared (in 1902) that
only one sign in two hundred had been interpreted with any
certainty<a name="FNanchor_1179_1179" id="FNanchor_1179_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a>, and although the system of A. H. Sayce<a name="FNanchor_1180_1180" id="FNanchor_1180_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a> is based
on a scientific plan, his decipherments must for the present
remain uncertain. The important tablets found by H. Winckler
in 1907<a name="FNanchor_1181_1181" id="FNanchor_1181_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a> at Boghaz Keui in Cappadocia, identified with
Khatti, the Hittite capital, have thrown much light on Hittite
history, and support many of Sayce's conjectures. The records<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
show that the Hittites were one of the great nations of antiquity,
with a power extending at its prime from the Asiatic
coast of the Aegean to Mesopotamia, and from the Black Sea
to Kadesh on the Orontes, a power which neither Egypt nor
Assyria could withstand. "It is still not certain to which of
the great families of nations they belonged. The suggestion
has been made that their language has certain Indo-European
characteristics; but for the present it is safer to regard them
as an indigenous race of Asia Minor. Their strongly-marked
facial type, with long, straight nose and receding forehead and
chin, is strikingly reproduced on all their monuments, and
suggests no comparison with Aryan or Semitic stocks<a name="FNanchor_1182_1182" id="FNanchor_1182_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a>."</p>

<p>F. von Luschan, however, is able to throw some light on
the ethnological history of the Hittites. When investigating
the early inhabitants of Western Asia he was constantly struck
by the appearance of a markedly non-Semitic type, which he
called "Armenoid." The most typical were the Tahtadji or
woodcutters of Western Lycia living up in the mountains and
totally distinct in every way from their Mohammedan neighbours.
"Their somatic characters are remarkably homogeneous;
they have a tawny white skin, much hair on the face,
straight hair, dark brown eyes, a narrow, generally aquiline
nose, and a very short and high head. The cephalic index
varies only from 82 to 91, with a maximum frequency of 86<a name="FNanchor_1183_1183" id="FNanchor_1183_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a>."
Similar types were found in the Bektash, who are town-dwellers
in Lycia, and in the Ansariyeh in Northern Syria. In Upper
Mesopotamia these features occur again among the Kyzylbash,
and in Western Kurdistan among the Yezidi. "We find a
small minority of groups possessing a similarity of creed and
a remarkable uniformity of type, scattered over a vast part of
Western Asia. I see no other way to account for this fact
than to assume that the members of all these sects are the
remains of an old homogeneous population, which have preserved
their religion and have therefore refrained from intermarriage
with strangers and so preserved their old physical
characteristics<a name="FNanchor_1184_1184" id="FNanchor_1184_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a>." They all speak the languages of their orthodox<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
neighbours, Turkish, Arabic and Kurdish, but are absolutely
homogeneous as to their somatic characters. Two other
groups with the same physical type are the Druses of the
Lebanon and Antilebanos country, who speak Arabic and pass
officially as Mohammedans, though their secret creed contains
many Christian, Jewish and pantheistic elements. To the
north of the Druses are the Christian Maronites, said to be
the descendants of a Monophysite sect, separated from the
common Christian Church after the Council of Chalcedon in
451 <small>A.D.</small> "Partly through their isolation in the mountains,
partly through their not intermarrying with their Mahometan
or Druse neighbours, the Maronites of today have preserved
an old type in almost marvellous purity. In no other Oriental
group is there a greater number of men with extreme height
of the skull and excessive flattening of the occipital region
than among the Maronites.... Very often their occiput is so
steep that one is again and again inclined to think of artificial
deformation." But "no such possibility is found<a name="FNanchor_1185_1185" id="FNanchor_1185_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a>."</p>

<p>These hypsibrachycephalic groups with high narrow noses,
found also in Persia, among Turks, Greeks, and still more
commonly among Armenians, were first (1892) called by von
Luschan "Armenoid," but "there can be no doubt that they
are all descended from tribes belonging to the great Hittite
Empire. So it is the type of the Hittites that has been preserved
in all these groups for more than 3000 years<a name="FNanchor_1186_1186" id="FNanchor_1186_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a>." As to
their primordial home von Luschan connects them with the
"Alpine Race" of Central Europe, but leaves it an open
question whether the Hittites came from Central Europe, or
the Alpine Race from Western Asia, though inclining to the
latter view. The high narrow nose (the essential somatic
difference between the Hittites and the other brachycephalic
Arabs) "originated as a merely accidental mutation and was
then locally fixed, either by a certain tendency of taste and
fashion or by long, perhaps millennial in-breeding. The
'Hittite nose' has finally become a dominant characteristic
in the Mendelian sense, and we see it, not only in the actual
geographical province of the Alpine Race, but often enough
also here in England<a href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arabia and the
Arabs.</div>

<p>In Arabia itself inscriptions point to the early existence of
civilised kingdoms, among which those of the Sabaeans<a name="FNanchor_1187_1187" id="FNanchor_1187_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a> and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
the Minaeans<a name="FNanchor_1188_1188" id="FNanchor_1188_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a> stand out most clearly, though their dates and
even their chronological order are much disputed.
Possibly both lasted until the rise of the Himyarites
at the beginning of the Christian era. All are
agreed however that Arabian civilisation reached a very high
level in the centuries preceding the birth of the Prophet, before
the increase in shipping led to the abandonment of the caravan
trade.</p>

<p>The modern inhabitants are divided into the Southern
Arabians, mainly settled agriculturalists of Yemen, Hadramaut
and Oman, who trace their descent from Shem, and the
Northern Arabians (Bedouin<a name="FNanchor_1189_1189" id="FNanchor_1189_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a>), pastoral tribes, who trace
their descent from Ishmael. The two groups have even been
considered ethnologically distinct, but, as von Luschan points
out, "peninsular Arabia is the least-known land in the world,
and large regions of it are even now absolutely <i>terrae incognitae</i>,
so great caution is necessary in forming conclusions, from
the measurements of a few dozens of men, concerning the anthropology
of a land more than five times as great as France<a name="FNanchor_1190_1190" id="FNanchor_1190_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a>."
His measurements of "the only real Semites, the Bedawy,"
gave a cephalic index ranging from 68 to 78, while the nose
was short and fairly broad, very seldom of a "Jewish type."
Recently Seligman<a name="FNanchor_1191_1191" id="FNanchor_1191_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> has shown that whereas the Semites of
Northern Arabia conform more or less to the type just mentioned
those of Southern Arabia are of low or median stature
(1.62-1.65 m., 63&frac34;-65 in.), and are predominantly brachycephalic,
the cephalic index ranging from 71 to 92, with an
average of about 82.</p>

<p>Elsewhere&mdash;Iberia, Sicily, Malta<a name="FNanchor_1192_1192" id="FNanchor_1192_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a>, Irania, Central Asia, Malaysia&mdash;the
Arab invaders have failed to preserve either their
speech or their racial individuality. In some places (Spain,
Portugal, Sicily) they have disappeared altogether, leaving
nothing behind them beyond some slight linguistic traces, and
the monuments of their wonderful architecture, crumbling Alhambras
or stupendous mosques re-consecrated as Christian
temples. But in the eastern lands their influence is still felt by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
multitudes, who profess Isl&aacute;m and use the Arabic script in
writing their Persian, Turki, or Malay languages, because some
centuries ago those regions were swept by a tornado of rude
Bedouin fanatics, or else visited by peaceful traders and missionaries
from the Arabian peninsula.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Semitic
Monotheism.</div>

<p>The monotheism proclaimed by these zealous preachers is
often spoken of as a special inheritance of the Semitic peoples,
or at least already possessed by them at such an
early period in their life-history as to seem inseparable
from their very being. But it was not
so. Before the time of Allah or of Jahveh every hill-top had
its tutelar deity; the caves and rocks and the very atmosphere
swarmed with "jins"; Assyrian and Phoenician pantheons,
with their Baals, and Molochs, and Astartes and Adonais, were
as thickly peopled as those of the Hellenes and Hindus, and
in this, as in all other natural systems of belief, the monotheistic
concept was gradually evolved by a slow process of elimination.
Nor was the process perfected by all the Semitic peoples&mdash;Canaanites,
Assyrians, Amorites, Phoenicians, and others having
always remained at the polytheistic stage&mdash;but only by the
Hebrews and the Arabs, the two more richly endowed members
of the Semitic family. Even here a reservation has to
be made, for we now know that there was really but one
evolution, that of Jahveh, the adoption of the idea embodied
in Allah being historically traceable to the Jewish and Christian
systems. As Jastrow points out, the higher religious and
ethical movement began with Moses, who invested the national
Jahveh with ethical traits, thus paving the way for the wider
conceptions of the Prophets. "The point of departure in the
Hebrew religion from that of the Semitic in general did not
come until the rise of a body of men who set up a new ideal of
divine government of the universe, and with it as a necessary
corollary a new standard of religious conduct. Throwing aside
the barriers of tribal limitations to the jurisdiction of a deity,
it was the Hebrew Prophets who first prominently and emphatically
brought forth the view of a divine power conceived
in spiritual terms, who, in presiding over the universe and in
controlling the fates of nations and individuals, acts from self-imposed
laws of righteousness tempered with mercy<a name="FNanchor_1193_1193" id="FNanchor_1193_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a>."</p>

<p>As the result of recent researches there is an end of the
theory that bronze came in with the "Aryans," and it is from
this standpoint that the revelation of an independent Aegean
culture in touch with Babylonia and Egypt some four millenniums
before the new era is of such momentous import in
determining the ethnical relations of the historical, <i>i.e.</i> the
present European populations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">European
Trade
Routes.</div>

<p>Some idea of cultured relations in prehistoric times may be
obtained from a review of the trade communications as indicated
by archaeology during the Bronze Age
which lasted through the whole of the third
millennium down to the middle of the second.
As we have seen, in the Nile valley, in Mesopotamia and in
the Aegean area, remains characteristic of Bronze Age culture
rest on a neolithic substratum, and a transitional stage, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
gold and copper were the only metals known, often connects
the two. From the time of this dawning of the Age of Metals,
the inhabitants of the Nile Valley, of Crete, of Cyprus and of
the mainland of Greece freely exchanged their products.
Navigation was already flourishing, and the sea united rather
than divided the insular and coastal populations. Gradually
Egeo-Mykenaean civilisation extended from Crete and the
Greek lands to the west, influencing Sicily directly, and
leaving distinct traces in Southern Italy, Sardinia and the
Iberian peninsula, while Iberia in its turn contributed to the
development of Western Gaul and the British Isles. The
knowledge of copper, and, soon after, that of bronze, spread
by the Atlantic route to Ireland, while Central Europe was
reached directly from the south. Thanks to the trade in amber,
always in demand by the Mediterranean populations, there
was a continuous trade route to Scandinavia, which thus had
direct communication with Southern Europe. As civilisation
developed, the lands of the north and west became exporters
as well as importers, each developing a distinct industry not
always inferior to the more precocious culture of the south<a name="FNanchor_1194_1194" id="FNanchor_1194_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Aryan"
Migrations.</div>

<p>With trade communications thus stretching across Europe
from south to north, and from east to extreme west, it would
seem not improbable that movements of peoples
were equally unrestricted, and this would account
for the appearance on the threshold of history of
various peoples formerly grouped together on account of their
language, as "Aryan." J. L. Myres, however, is inclined to
attribute "the coming of the North" to the same type of
climatic impulse which induced the Semitic swarms described
above (p. 489). After referring to the earliest occurrence of
Indo-European names<a name="FNanchor_1195_1195" id="FNanchor_1195_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a>, he continues "Before the time of the
Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt there had been a very extensive
raid of Indo-European-speaking folk by way of the Persian
plateau, as far as the Syrian coastland and the interior of Asia
Minor." These raids coincide with a new cultural feature of
great significance. "It is of the first importance to find that
it is in the dark period which immediately precedes the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
Eighteenth Dynasty revival&mdash;when Egypt was prostrate under
mysterious 'Shepherd Kings,' and Babylon under Kassite
invaders equally mysterious&mdash;that the civilized world first
became acquainted with one of the greatest blessings of civilisation,
the domesticated horse. The period of Arabian
drought, which drove forth the 'Canaanite' emigrants, may
have had its counterpart on the northern steppe, to provoke
the migration of these horsemen." He adds, however, "our
knowledge both of the extent of these droughts and of the
chronology of both these migrations, is too vague for this to
be taken as more than a provisional basis for more exact
enquiry<a name="FNanchor_1196_1196" id="FNanchor_1196_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indo-European
Cradle.</div>

<p>The attempt has often been made to locate the original
home of the Indo-European people by an appeal to philology,
and idyllic pictures have been drawn up of the
"Aryan family" consisting of the father the protector,
the mother the producer, and the children
"whose name implied that they kept everything clean and
neat<a name="FNanchor_1197_1197" id="FNanchor_1197_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a>." They were regarded as originally pastoral and later
agricultural, ranging over a wide area with Bactria for its
centre. With advancing knowledge of what is primitive in
Indo-European this circumstantial picture crumbled to pieces,
and Feist<a name="FNanchor_1198_1198" id="FNanchor_1198_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a> reduces all inferences deducible from linguistic
palaeontology to the sole "argumentum ex silencio" (which
he regards as distinctly untrustworthy in itself), that the
"Urheimat" was a country in which in the middle of the third
millennium <small>B.C.</small> such southern animals as lion, elephant, and
tiger, were unknown. It was commonly assumed that the
"Aryan cradle" was in Asia, and the suggestion of R. G. Latham
in 1851 that the original home was in Europe was
scouted by one of the most eminent writers on the subject&mdash;Victor
Hehn&mdash;as lunacy possible only to one who lived in a
country of cranks<a href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a>. But since this date, there has been a
shifting of the "Urheimat" further and further west.
O. Schrader<a name="FNanchor_1199_1199" id="FNanchor_1199_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a> places it in South Russia, G. Kossinna<a name="FNanchor_1200_1200" id="FNanchor_1200_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a> and

many others go still further north, deriving both language and
tall fair dolichocephalic speakers (proto-Teutons) from Scandinavia<a name="FNanchor_1202_1202" id="FNanchor_1202_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a>.</p>

associated with pre-neolithic and with neolithic kitchen-middens,
is prepared to attribute the former to aboriginal inhabitants,
Ligurians, and, further north, Kvaens (Finns, Lapps), and the
neolithic civilisation of Europe to Indo-Europeans. "Thus
the neolithic Indo-Europeans would already have advanced as
far as South Sweden in the Litorina period of the Baltic, during
the oak-period."</p>

<p>On the other hand the discovery of Tocharish has inclined
E. Meyer<a name="FNanchor_1204_1204" id="FNanchor_1204_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a> to reconsider an Asiatic origin, but the information
as to this language is too fragmentary to be conclusive on this
point. After reviewing the various theories Giles<a name="FNanchor_1205_1205" id="FNanchor_1205_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a> concludes
"in the great plain which extends across Europe north of the
Alps and Carpathians and across Asia north of the Hindu
Kush there are few geographical obstacles to prevent the rapid
spread of peoples from any part of its area to any other, and,
as we have seen, the Celts and the Hungarians etc. have in the
historical period demonstrated the rapidity with which such
migrations could be made. Such migrations may possibly
account for the appearance of a people using a <i>centum</i> language
so far east as Turkestan<a name="FNanchor_1206_1206" id="FNanchor_1206_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indo-European

<p>More acrimonious than the discussion of the original home
is the dispute as to the original physical type of the Indo-European-speaking
people. It was almost a matter of
faith with Germans that the language was introduced
by tall fair dolichocephals of Nordic
type. On the other hand the Gallic school sought to identify
the Alpine race as the only and original Aryans. The futility
of the whole discussion is ably demonstrated by W. Z. Ripley
in his protest against the confusion of language and race<a name="FNanchor_1207_1207" id="FNanchor_1207_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a>.

about the physical type of the "Urvolk" is that since the Indo-Europeans
came from a northerly region<a name="FNanchor_1209_1209" id="FNanchor_1209_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1209_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a> (not yet identified)
it is surmised that they belonged to the light-skinned people.
The observation that mountain folk of Indo-Germanic speech
in southern areas, such as the Ossets of the Caucasus, the
Kurds of the uplands of Armenia and Irania, and the Tajiks
of the western Pamirs not infrequently exhibit fair hair or blue
eyes supports this view. Nevertheless, as he points out,
brachycephals are not hereby excluded. His own conclusion,
which naturally results from a review of the whole evidence,
is that the "Urvolk" was not a pure race, but a mixture of
different types. Already in neolithic times races in Europe
were no longer pure, and in France "formed an almost inextricable
medley" and Feist assumes with E. de Michelis<a name="FNanchor_1210_1210" id="FNanchor_1210_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a> that
the Indo-Europeans were a conglomerate of peoples of different
origins who in prehistoric times were welded together into an
ethnic unity, as the present English have been formed from
pre-Indo-European Caledonians (Picts and Scots), Celts,
Roman traders and soldiers and later Teutonic settlers<a name="FNanchor_1211_1211" id="FNanchor_1211_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Date of
Indo-European
expansion.</div>

<p>The evidence that Indo-Europeans were already in existence
in Mesopotamia, Syria and Irania about the middle of
the second millennium <small>B.C.</small> has already been
mentioned. About the same time the Vedic
hymns bear witness to the appearance of the
Aryans of Western India. The formation of an Aryan group
with a common language, religion and culture is a process
necessarily requiring considerable length of time, so that their
swarming off from the Indo-European parent group must be
pushed back to far into the third millennium. At this period
there are indications of the settling of the Greeks in the
southern promontories of the Balkan peninsula at latest about
2000 <small>B.C.</small>, while Thracian and Illyrian peoples may have filled
the mainland, though the Dorians occupied Epirus, Macedonia,
and perhaps Southern Illyria. Indo-European stocks were
already in occupation of Central Italy. It would appear therefore
that the period of the Indo-European community, before
the migrations, must be placed at the end of the Stone Ages,
at the time when copper was first introduced. Thus it seems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
legitimate to infer that the expansion of the Indo-Europeans
began about 2500 <small>B.C.</small> and the furthest advanced branches
entered into the regions of the older populations and cultures
at latest after the beginning of the second millennium<a name="FNanchor_1212_1212" id="FNanchor_1212_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a>. About
1000 <small>B.C.</small> we find three areas occupied by Indo-European-speaking
peoples, all widely separated from each other and
apparently independent. These are (1) the Aryan groups in
Asia; (2) the Balkan peninsula together with Central and
Lower Italy, and the Mysians and Phrygians of Asia Minor
(possibly the Thracians had already advanced across the
Danube); and (3) Teutons, Celts and Letto-Slavs over the
greater part of Germany and Scandinavia, perhaps also already
in Eastern France and in Poland. The following centuries saw
the advance of Iranians to South Russia and further west, the
pressing of the Phrygians into Armenia, and lastly the Celtic
migrations in Western Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of the
Nordic
Peoples.</div>

<p>From the linguistic and botanical evidence brought forward
by the Polish botanist Rostaf&iacute;nski<a name="FNanchor_1213_1213" id="FNanchor_1213_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a> the ancestors of the Celts,
Germans and Balto-Slavs must have occupied a
region north of the Carpathians, and west of a line
between K&ouml;nigsberg and Odessa (the beech and
yew zone). The Balto-Slavs subsequently lost the word for
beech and transferred the word for yew to the sallow and black
alder (both with red wood) but their possession of a word for
hornbeam locates their original home in Polesie&mdash;the marshland
traversed by the Pripet but not south or east of Kiev.</p>

<p>Although, owing to the absence of Teutonic inscriptions
before the third or fourth century <small>A.D.</small> it is difficult to trace the
Nordic peoples with any certainty during the Bronze or Early
Iron Ages, yet the fairly well-defined group of Bronze Age
antiquities, covering the basin of the Elbe, Mecklenburg,
Holstein, Jutland, Southern Sweden and the islands of the
Belt have been conjectured with much probability to represent
early Teutonic civilisation. "Whether we are justified in
speaking of a Teutonic race in the anthropological sense is at
least doubtful, for the most striking characteristics of these
peoples [as deduced from prehistoric skeletons, descriptions of
ancient writers and present day statistics] occur also to a considerable
extent among their eastern and western neighbours,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
where they can hardly be ascribed altogether to Teutonic
admixture. The only result of anthropological investigation
which so far can be regarded as definitely established is that
the old Teutonic lands in Northern Germany, Denmark and
Southern Sweden have been inhabited by people of the same
type since the neolithic age if not earlier<a name="FNanchor_1214_1214" id="FNanchor_1214_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a>." This type is
characterised by tall stature, long narrow skull, light complexion
with light hair and eyes<a name="FNanchor_1215_1215" id="FNanchor_1215_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Cimbri
and Teutoni.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The
Bastarnae.</div>

<p>During the age of national migrations, from the fourth to
the sixth century, the territories of the Nordic peoples were
vastly extended, partly by conquest, and partly
by arrangement with the Romans. But these
movements had begun before the new era, for we
hear of the <i>Cimbri</i> invading Illyricum, Gaul and Italy in the
second century <small>B.C.</small> probably from Jutland<a name="FNanchor_1216_1216" id="FNanchor_1216_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a>, where they were
apparently associated with the <i>Teutoni</i>. Still earlier, in the
third century <small>B.C.</small>, the <i>Bastarnae</i>, said by many ancient writers
to have been Teutonic in origin, invaded and
settled between the Carpathians and the Black
Sea. Already mentioned doubtfully by Strabo
as separating the Germani from the Scythians (Tyragetes)
about the Dniester and Dnieper, their movements may now
be followed by authentic documents from the Baltic to the
Euxine. Furtw&auml;ngler<a name="FNanchor_1217_1217" id="FNanchor_1217_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a> shows that the earliest known German
figures are those of the Adamklissi monument, in the Dobruja,
commemorating the victory of Crassus over the Bastarnae,
Getae, and Thracians in 28 <small>B.C.</small> The Bastarnae migrated before
the Cimbri and Teutons through the Vistula valley to the
Lower Danube about 200 <small>B.C.</small> They had relations with the
Macedonians, and the successes of Mithridates over the
Romans were due to their aid. The account of their overthrow
by Crassus in Dio Cassius is in striking accord with the scenes
on the Adamklissi monument. Here they appear dressed only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
in a kind of trowsers, with long pointed beards, and defiant
but noble features. The same type recurs both on the column
of Trajan, who engaged them as auxiliaries in his Dacian wars,
and on the Arch of Marcus Aurelius, here however wearing a
tunic, a sign perhaps of later Roman influences. And thus
after 2000 years are answered Strabo's doubts by modern
archaeology.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Moeso-Goths.</div>

<p>Much later there followed along the same beaten track
between the Baltic and Black Sea a section of the Goths,
whom we find first settled in the Baltic lands in
proximity to the Finns. The exodus from this
region can scarcely have taken place before the
second century of the new era, for they are still unknown to
Strabo, while Tacitus locates them on the Baltic between the
Elbe and the Vistula. Later Cassiodorus and others bring
them from Scandinavia to the Vistula, and up that river to the
Euxine and Lower Danube. Although often regarded as
legendary<a name="FNanchor_1218_1218" id="FNanchor_1218_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a>, this migration is supported by archaeological
evidence. In 1837 a gold torque with a Gothic inscription was
found at Petroassa in Wallachia, and in 1858 an iron spear-head
with a Gothic name in the same script, which dates from
the first Iron Age, turned up near Kovel in Volhynia. The
spear-head is identical with one found in 1865 at M&uuml;nchenberg
in Brandenburg, on which Wimmer remarks that "of 15 Runic
inscriptions in Germany the two earliest occur on iron pikes.
There is no doubt that the runes of the Kovel spear-head and
of the ring came from Gothic tribes<a name="FNanchor_1219_1219" id="FNanchor_1219_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a>." These Southern Goths,
later called Moeso-Goths, because they settled in Moesia
(Bulgaria and Servia), had certain physical and even moral
characters of the Old Teutons, as seen in the Emperor Maximinus,
born in Thrace of a Goth by an Alan woman&mdash;very
tall, strong, handsome, with light hair and milk-white skin<a name="FNanchor_1220_1220" id="FNanchor_1220_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a>,
temperate in all things and of great mental energy.</p>

<p>Before their absorption in the surrounding Bulgar and Slav
populations the Moeso-Goths were evangelised in the fourth
century by their bishop Ulfilas ("Wolf"), whose fragmentary
translation of Scripture, preserved in the <i>Codex Argenteus</i> of
Upsala, is the most precious monument of early Teutonic
speech extant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Scandinavia.</div>

<p>To find the pure Nordic type at the present day we must
seek for it in Scandinavia, which possesses one of the most
highly individualised populations in Europe. The
Osterdal, and the neighbourhood of Vaage in
Upper Gudbrandsdal in Norway, and the Dalarna district in
Sweden contain perhaps the purest Teutonic type in all
Europe, the cephalic index falling well below 78. But along
the Norwegian coasts there is a strong tendency to brachycephaly
(the index rising to 82-3), combined with a darkening
of the hair and eye colour (the type occurs also in Denmark),
indicating an outlying lodgement of the Alpine race from
Central Europe. The anthropological history of Scandinavia,
according to Ripley, is as follows: "Norway has ... probably been
peopled from two directions, one element coming from Sweden
and another from the south by way of Denmark. The latter
type, now found on the sea coast and especially along the least
attractive portion of it, has been closely hemmed in by the
Teutonic immigration from Sweden<a name="FNanchor_1221_1221" id="FNanchor_1221_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a>." Brachycephalic people
already occupied parts of Denmark in the Stone Age<a name="FNanchor_1222_1222" id="FNanchor_1222_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a>, and,
according to the scanty information available, the present
population is extremely mixed. One-third of the children
have light hair and light eyes, and tall stature coincides in the
main with fair colouring, but in Bornholm where the cephalic
index is 80 there is a taller dark type and a shorter light type,
the latter perhaps akin to the Eastern variety of the Alpine
race<a name="FNanchor_1223_1223" id="FNanchor_1223_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Modification
of the Nordic
Type.</div>

<p>The original Nordic type is by no means universally
represented among the present Germanic peoples. From the
examination made some years ago of 6,758,000
school children<a name="FNanchor_1224_1224" id="FNanchor_1224_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a>, it would appear that about 31 per
cent. of living Germans may be classed as blonds,
14 as brunettes, and 55 as mixed; and further that of the
blonds about 43 per cent. are centred in North, 33 in Central
and 24 in South Germany. The brunettes increase, generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
speaking, southwards, South Bavaria showing only about
14 per cent. of blonds, and the same law holds good of the
long-heads and the round-heads respectively. To what cause
is to be attributed this profound modification of this branch of
the Nordic type in the direction of the south?</p>

<p>That the Teutons ranged in considerable numbers far
beyond their northern seats is proved by the spread of the
German language to the central highlands, and beyond them
down the southern slopes, where a rude High German dialect
lingered on in the so-called "Seven Communes" of the
Veronese district far into the nineteenth century. But after
passing the Main, which appears to have long formed the
ethnical divide for Central Europe, they entered the zone of
the brown Alpine round-heads<a name="FNanchor_1225_1225" id="FNanchor_1225_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a>, to whom they communicated
their speech, but by whom they were largely modified in
physical appearance. The process has for long ages been
much the same everywhere&mdash;perennial streams of Teutonism
setting steadily from the north, all successively submerged in
the great ocean of dark round-headed humanity, which under
many names has occupied the central uplands and eastern plains
since the Neolithic Age, overflowing also in later times into
the Balkan Peninsula.</p>

<p>This absorption of what is assumed to be the superior in
the inferior type, may be due to the conditions of the general
movement&mdash;warlike bands, accompanied by few women, appearing
as conquerors in the midst of the Alpines and merging
with them in the great mass of brachycephalic peoples. Or is the
transformation to be explained by de Lapouge's doctrine, that
cranial forms are not so much a question of race as of social
conditions, and that, owing to the increasingly unfavourable
nature of these conditions, there is a general tendency for the
superior long-heads to be absorbed in the inferior round-heads<a name="FNanchor_1226_1226" id="FNanchor_1226_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a>.</p>

<p>The fact that dolichocephaly is more prevalent in cities and
brachycephaly in rural areas has been interpreted in various
ways. De Lapouge<a name="FNanchor_1227_1227" id="FNanchor_1227_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a> contended that in France the restless and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
more enterprising long-heads migrated from the rural districts
in disproportionate numbers to the towns, where they died out.
For the department of Aveyron he gives a table showing a
steady rise of the cephalic index from 71.4 in prehistoric times
to 86.5 in 1899, and attributes this to the dolichos gravitating
chiefly to the large towns, as O. Ammon has also shown for
Baden. L. Laloy summed up the results thus: France is being
depopulated, and, what is worse, it is precisely the best section
of the inhabitants that disappears, the section most productive
in eminent men in all departments of learning, while the
ignorant and rude <i>pecus</i> alone increase.</p>

<p>These views have met with favour even across the Atlantic,
but are by no means universally accepted. The ground seems
cut from the whole theory by A. Macalister, who read a paper at
the Toronto Meeting of the British Association, 1897, on
"The Causes of Brachycephaly," showing that the infantile
and primitive skull is relatively long, and that there is a gradual
change, phylogenetic (racial) as well as ontogenetic (individual)
toward brachycephaly, which is certainly correlated with, and
is apparently produced by, cerebral activity and growth; in the
process of development in the individual and the race the
frontal lobes of the brain grow the more rapidly and tend to
fill out and broaden the skull<a name="FNanchor_1228_1228" id="FNanchor_1228_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a>. The tendency would thus
have nothing to do with rustic and urban life, nor would the
round be necessarily, if at all, inferior to the long head. Some
of de Lapouge's generalisations are also traversed by Livi<a name="FNanchor_1229_1229" id="FNanchor_1229_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a>,
Deniker<a name="FNanchor_1230_1230" id="FNanchor_1230_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a>, Sergi<a name="FNanchor_1231_1231" id="FNanchor_1231_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a> and others, and the whole question is admirably
summarised by W. Z. Ripley<a name="FNanchor_1232_1232" id="FNanchor_1232_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Celto-Slavs.</div>

<p>But whatever be the cause, the fact must be accepted that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span><i>Homo Europaeus</i> (the Nordics) becomes merged southwards
in <i>Homo Alpinus</i> whose names, as stated, are many. Broca
and many continental writers use the name <i>Kelt</i>
or <i>Slavo-Kelt</i>, which has led to much confusion.
But it merely means for them the great mass
of brachycephalic peoples in Central Europe, where, at various
times, Celtic and Slavonic languages have prevailed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aberrant
Tyrolese Type.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Rhaetians
and Etruscans.</div>

<p>It is remarkable that in the Alpine region, especially Tyrol,
where the brachy element comes to a focus, there is a peculiar
form of round-head which has greatly puzzled de
Lapouge, but may perhaps be accounted for on
the hypothesis of two brachy types here fused in
one. To explain the exceedingly round Tyrolese head, which
shows affinities on the one hand with the Swiss, on the other
with the Illyrian and Albanian, that is, with the normal Alpine,
a Mongol strain has been suggested, but is rightly rejected by
Franz Tappeiner as inadmissible on many grounds<a name="FNanchor_1233_1233" id="FNanchor_1233_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a>. De
Ujfalvy<a name="FNanchor_1234_1234" id="FNanchor_1234_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a>, a follower of de Lapouge, looks on
the hyperbrachy Tyrolese as descendants of the
ancient Rhaetians or Rasenes, whom so many
regard as the parent stock of the Etruscans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Etruscan
Origins.</div>

<p>But Montelius (with most other modern ethnologists) rejects
the land route from the north, and brings the Etruscans by
the sea route direct from the Aegean and Lydia (Asia Minor).
They are the Thessalian Pelasgians whom Hellanikos of
Lesbos brings to Campania, or the Tyrrhenian Pelasgians
transported by Antiklides from Asia Minor to Etruria, and he
is "quite sure that the archaeological facts in Central and North
Italy ... prove the truth of this tradition<a name="FNanchor_1235_1235" id="FNanchor_1235_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a>." Of course, until the
affinities of the Etruscan language are determined, from which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>we are still as far off as ever<a name="FNanchor_1236_1236" id="FNanchor_1236_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a>, Etruscan origins must remain
chiefly an archaeological question. Even the
help afforded by the crania from the Etruscan
tombs is but slight, both long and round heads
being here found in the closest association. Sergi, who also
brings the Etruscans from the east, explains this by supposing
that, being Pelasgians, they were of the same dolicho Mediterranean
stock as the Italians (Ligurians) themselves, and
differed only from the brachy Umbrians of Aryan speech.
Hence the skulls from the tombs are of two types, the intruding
Aryan, and the Mediterranean, the latter, whether representing
native Ligurians or intruding Etruscans, being indistinguishable.
"I can show," he says, "Etruscan crania, which differ
in no respect from the Italian [Ligurian], from the oldest
graves, as I can also show heads from the Etruscan graves
which do not differ from those still found in Aryan lands,
whether Slav, Keltic, or Germanic<a name="FNanchor_1237_1237" id="FNanchor_1237_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a>." Perhaps the difficulty
is best explained by Feist's suggestion that the Etruscans
were merely a highly civilised warlike aristocracy, spreading
thinly over the conquered population by which they were
ultimately absorbed<a name="FNanchor_1238_1238" id="FNanchor_1238_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Celts.</div>

<p>The migrations of the Celts preceded those of the
Teutonic peoples to whom they were probably closely related
in race as in language<a name="FNanchor_1239_1239" id="FNanchor_1239_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a>. At the beginning of
the historical period Celts are found in the west
of Germany in the region of the Rhine and the Weser. Possibly
about 600 <small>B.C.</small> they occupied Gaul and parts of the Iberian
peninsula, subsequently crossing over into the British Isles.
In Italy they came into conflict with the rising power of Rome,
and, after the battle of the Allia (390 <small>B.C.</small>) occupied Rome
itself. Descents were also made into the Danube valley and the
Balkans, and later (280 <small>B.C.</small>) into Thessaly. At the height of
their power they extended from the north of Scotland to the
southern shores of Spain and Portugal, and from the northern
coasts of Germany to a little south of Senegaglia. To the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
west their boundary was the Atlantic, to the east, the Black
Sea<a name="FNanchor_1240_1240" id="FNanchor_1240_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Definition of
"Celt."</div>

<p>Unfortunately the indiscriminate use of the term Celt has
led to much confusion. For historians and geographers the
Celts are the people in the centre and west of
Europe referred to by writers of antiquity under
the names of <i>Keltoi</i>, <i>Celtae</i>, <i>Galli</i> and <i>Galatae</i>.
But many anthropologists, especially on the continent, regard
Celts and Gauls as representing two well-determined physical
types, the former brachycephalic, with short sturdy build and
chestnut coloured hair (Alpine type), and the latter dolichocephalic
with tall stature, fair complexion and light hair (Nordic
type). Linguists, ignoring physical characters, class as Celts
those people who speak an Indo-European language characterised
in particular by the loss of p and by the modifications
undergone by mutation of initial consonants, while for many
archaeologists the Celts were the people responsible for the
spread of the civilisation of the Hallstatt and La T&egrave;ne periods,
that is of the earlier and later Iron Age<a name="FNanchor_1241_1241" id="FNanchor_1241_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a>.</p>

<p>It is not surprising therefore that it has been proposed to
drop the word Celt out of anthropological nomenclature, as
having no ethnical significance. But this, says Rice Holmes<a name="FNanchor_1242_1242" id="FNanchor_1242_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a>,
"is because writers on ethnology have not kept their heads
clear." And in particular one point has been overlooked.
"Just as the French are called after one conquering people,
the Franks; just as the English are called after one conquering
people, the Angles; so the heterogeneous Celtae of Transalpine
Gaul were called after one conquering people; and that people
were the Celts, or rather a branch of the Celts in the true
sense of the word. The Celts, in short, were the people who
introduced the Celtic language into Gaul, into Asia Minor,
and into Britain; the people who included the victors of the
Allia, the conquerors of Gallia Celtica, and the conquerors of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
Gallia Bel&#291;ica; the people whom Polybius called indifferently
Gauls and Celts; the people who, as Pausanius said, were
originally called Celts and afterwards called Gauls. If certain
ancient writers confounded the tall fair Celts who spoke Celtic
with the tall fair Germans who spoke German the ancient
writers who were better informed avoided such a mistake....
Let us therefore restore to the word 'Celt' the ethnical significance
which of right belongs to it."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Celts in
Britain.</div>

<p>It is not certain at what date the Celtic tribes effected
settlements in Great Britain, but it is held by many that the
earliest invasions were not prior to the sixth or
possibly even the fifth century. At the time of
the Roman conquest the Celts were divided into
two linguistic groups, <i>Goidelic</i>, represented at the present day
by Irish, Manx and Scotch Gaelic, and <i>Brythonic</i>, including
Welsh, Cornish and Breton. These groups must have been
virtually identical save in two particulars. In Brythonic the
labial velar q became p (a change which apparently took place
before the time of Pytheas), whilst in Goidelic the sound
remained unaltered. q is retained in the earlier ogham inscriptions,
but by the end of the seventh century it had lost the
labial element, appearing in Old Irish as c. Thus O. Irish
<i>cenn</i>, head, as in Kenmare, Kintyre, Kinsale, equates with
Brythonic <i>pen</i>, as in Penryn (Cornwall), Penrhyn (Wales),
Penkridge (Staffordshire), Penruddock, Penrith and many
others. The two groups are therefore distinguished as the Q
Celts and the P Celts<a name="FNanchor_1243_1243" id="FNanchor_1243_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a>. From the fact that Goidelic retained
the q it has been commonly assumed that the Goidels were
separated from the main Celtic stock at a time before the
labialisation had taken place, but many scholars maintain that
the parent Goidelic was evolved in Ireland, and was carried
from that island to Man and Scotland in the early centuries of
our era<a name="FNanchor_1244_1244" id="FNanchor_1244_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Picts.</div>

<p>From an anthropological point of view, the Picts are if
possible more difficult to identify than the Celts. But the
question is not between tall fair long-heads and
short dark round-heads, but between short dark
long-heads (neolithic aborigines) and Celts. The Pictish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
question is summed up by Rice Holmes<a name="FNanchor_1245_1245" id="FNanchor_1245_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a> and the various
theories have been more recently reviewed by Windisch<a name="FNanchor_1246_1246" id="FNanchor_1246_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a> giving
a valuable summary of earlier writings. On the one hand
it is maintained as "the most tenable hypothesis that the
Picts were non-Aryans, whom the first Celtic migrations
found already settled here ... descendants of the Aborigines<a name="FNanchor_1247_1247" id="FNanchor_1247_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a>."
Windisch<a name="FNanchor_1248_1248" id="FNanchor_1248_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a> at the other extreme, regards them as late comers
into North Britain, when Scotland was already occupied by
Brythonic tribes. But the geographical distribution of the
Picts in historical times suggests rather a people driven into
mountainous regions by successive conquerors, than the
settlements of successful invaders. Also it is not improbable
that the language of the Bronze Age lingered in these wilder
districts, and this would account for the fact that St Columba
had to employ an interpreter in his relations with the Picts;
though this is explained by others on the assumption that
Pictish was Brythonic. The linguistic evidence is however
extremely slight, only a few words presumably Pictish having
survived and these through Celtic writers. "The one absolutely
certain conclusion to which the student of ethnology
can come is that the name of the Picts has not been proved to
be of pre-Aryan origin<a name="FNanchor_1249_1249" id="FNanchor_1249_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a>." "For me," continues Rice Holmes
(p. 417), "the Picts were a mixed people comprising descendants
of the neolithic aborigines, of the Round Barrow Race,
and of the Celtic invaders&mdash;a mixed people who [or at least
whose aristocracy] spoke a Celtic dialect."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brachycephals
in Britain.</div>

<p>Before attempting a survey of the ethnology of Britain it
is necessary to ascertain what ethnic elements the area
contained before the arrival of the Celts. The
neolithic inhabitants, the short, dark dolichocephals
of Mediterranean type have already been
described (Ch. XIII.). Their remains are associated with the
characteristic forms of sepulchral monuments the dolmens and
the long barrows. But towards the end of the Stone Age a
brachycephalic race was already penetrating into the islands.
This appears to have been a peaceful infiltration, at any rate
in certain districts, where remains of the two types are found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
side by side and there is evidence of racial intermixture. The
brachycephals introduced a new form of sepulture, making
their burial mounds circular instead of elongated, whence
Thurnam's convenient formula, "long barrow, long skull;
round barrow, round skull." But the earlier view that there
was a definite transition from long heads, neolithic culture and
long barrows, to round heads, bronze culture and round barrows
can no longer be maintained. "It is often taken for granted
that no round barrows were erected in Britain before the close
of the Neolithic Age, and that the earliest of the brachycephalic
invaders whose remains have been found in them
landed with bronze weapons in their hands<a name="FNanchor_1250_1250" id="FNanchor_1250_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a>." But there is
abundant evidence that the brachycephalic element preceded
the knowledge of metals, and a number of round barrows in
Yorkshire and further north show no trace of bronze.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Round Barrow
Type.</div>

<p>Nevertheless the majority of the round barrows belong to
the Bronze Age, and the physical type of their builders is
sufficiently well marked. The stature is remarkably
tall, attaining a height of 1.763 m. or over
5 ft. 9 ins. The skull is brachycephalic with
an average index of about 80. It is also characterised by great
strength and ruggedness of outline, with (often) a sloping
forehead, prominent supraciliary ridges, and a certain degree
of prognathism.</p>

<p>According to Rolleston's description "The eyebrows must
have given a beetling and probably even formidable appearance
to the upper part of the face, whilst the boldly outstanding and
heavy cheekbones must have produced an impression of raw
and rough strength. Overhung at its root, the nose must
have projected boldly forward." And Thurnam adds "the
prominence of the large incisor and canine teeth is so great as
to give an almost bestial expression to the skull<a name="FNanchor_1251_1251" id="FNanchor_1251_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alpine Type.</div>

<p>Although this type is conveniently called the Round
Barrow type, or even the Round Barrow Race, the round
barrows also contain remains of a different racial
character. The skull form shows a more extreme
brachycephaly, with an index of 84 or 85, and exhibits none
of the rugged features associated with the true Round Barrow
type. On the contrary, of the two typical groups, one from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
round barrows in Glamorganshire, and the other from short
cists in Aberdeenshire not one of the skulls is prognathous,
the supraciliary ridges are but slightly developed, the cheek
bones are not prominent, the face is both broad and short and
the lower jaw is small. But the greatest contrast is in the
height, which averages in the two groups, 1.664 m. and 1.6 m.
respectively, <i>i.e.</i> 5 ft. 5&frac34; ins. and 5 ft. 3 ins. All these characters
connect this type closely with the Alpine type on the
continent.</p>

<p>These round-headed peoples have been the subject of much
discussion ably summarised and criticised by Rice Holmes,
whose conclusion perhaps best represents the view now taken
of their affinities and origins.</p>

<p>"The great mistake that has been made in discussing the
question is the not uncommon assumption that the brachycephalic
immigrants who buried their dead in round barrows
arrived in Britain at one time, and came from one place. Some
of them certainly appeared before the end of the Neolithic
Age: others may have introduced bronze implements or
ornaments; others doubtless came, in successive hordes, during
the course of the Bronze Age. Some of those who belonged
to the Grenelle race [Alpine type], who certainly came from
Eastern Europe and possibly from Asia, and whose centre of
dispersion was the Alpine region, may have started from
Gaul; others could have traced their origin to some Rhenish
tribe; and I am inclined to believe that those who belonged
to the characteristic rugged Round Barrow type crossed over,
for the most part, from Denmark or the out-lying islands<a name="FNanchor_1252_1252" id="FNanchor_1252_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Formation of
the English
Nation.</div>

<p>After the passage of the Romans, who mingled little with
the aborigines and made, perhaps, but slight impression on the
speech or type of the British populations, a great
transformation was effected in these respects by
the arrival of the historical Teutonic tribes. Hand
in hand with the Teutonic invasions went a lust for expansion
on the part of the peoples in Ireland. Settlements were effected
by them in South Wales and Anglesey, the Isle of Man and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
Argyll, probably also in North Devon and Cornwall. For
many generations the south and east of England were the
scenes of fierce struggles, during which the Romano-British
civilisation perished. Only in more inaccessible districts, such
as the fen country, may a British population have survived,
though Celtic languages are not yet dislodged from their
mountain strongholds in Wales and Scotland, and lingered for
many centuries in Strathclyde and Cornwall. After the
strengthening of the Teutonic element by the arrival of the
Scandinavians and Normans, all very much of the same
physical type, no serious accessions were made to this composite
ethnical group, which on the east side ranged
uninterruptedly from the Channel to the Grampians. Later
the expansion was continued northwards beyond the
Grampians, and westwards through Strathclyde to Ireland,
while now the spread of education and the development of the
industries are already threatening to absorb the last strongholds
of Celtic speech in Wales, the Highlands, and Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethnic Relations
in
Ireland.</div>

<p>Thanks to its isolation in the extreme west, Ireland had been
left untouched by some of the above described ethnical movements.
It is doubtful whether Palaeolithic man
ever reached this region, and but few even of the
round-heads ranged so far west during the Bronze
Age<a name="FNanchor_1253_1253" id="FNanchor_1253_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a>. The land oscillations during post-Glacial times appear to
have been practically identical over an area including northern
Ireland, the southern half of Scotland, and northern England.
There was a period of depression followed by one of elevation.
The Larne beach-deposits prove that Neolithic man was in
existence from almost the beginning of the deposition of that
series until after its conclusion. The estuarine clays of Belfast
Lough correspond to the depression, and the Neolithic period
extended from at least near the top of the lower estuarine clay
to the beach-deposit of yellow sand which overlies it, or
possibly till later. It is to this period of elevation that the
Neolithic sites among the sand dunes of North Ireland belong;
those of Whitepark Bay and Portstewart, for example, extend
to the maximum elevation. A slight movement of subsidence
of about five feet in recent times has left the surface as we now
find it. The implements found in the Larne gravels correspond
to some extent with those of Danish kitchen-middens; this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
was not a dwelling site but a quarry-shop or roughing-out
place, the serviceable flakes being taken away for further
manipulation; it thus belongs to the earliest phase of neolithic
times. The sandhill sites were occupied, continuously and
occasionally, during neolithic times, through the Bronze Age,
and into the Iron and Christian periods<a name="FNanchor_1254_1254" id="FNanchor_1254_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a>. Nina F. Layard
has recently studied the Larne raised beach and exposed a new
section. She states that "Taken as a whole the flints certainly
do not correspond at all closely either to the Pal&aelig;oliths or
Neoliths so far found in England.... Some are strongly
reminiscent of well-known drift type.... Again, there are shapes
that bear a closer resemblance to some of the earliest Neolithic
types<a name="FNanchor_1255_1255" id="FNanchor_1255_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a>." She believes that, from their rolled condition, they
were derived from another source.</p>

<p>F. J. Bigger<a name="FNanchor_1256_1256" id="FNanchor_1256_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a> described some kitchen-middens at Portnafeadog,
near Roundstone, Connemara, which yielded stone
hammers but no worked flints, pottery or metal-ware. The
chief interest of this paper is due to the fact that it is the first
record of the occurrence of vast quantities of the shells of
<i>Purpura lapillus</i>, all of which were broken in such a manner
that the animal could easily be extracted. There can be no
doubt that the purple dye was manufactured here in prehistoric
times<a name="FNanchor_1257_1257" id="FNanchor_1257_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a>. W. J. Knowles<a name="FNanchor_1258_1258" id="FNanchor_1258_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a> suggests from the close resemblance&mdash;in
fact identity&mdash;of a great number of neolithic objects in
Ireland with palaeolithic forms in France (Saint-Acheul,
Moustier, Solutr&eacute;, La Madeleine types), that the Irish objects
bridge over the gap between the two ages, and were worked
by tribes from the continent following the migration of the
reindeer northwards. These peoples may have continued to
make tools of palaeolithic types, while at the same time coming
under the influence of the neolithic culture gradually arriving
from some southern region. The astonishing development of
this neolithic culture in the remote island on the confines of the
west, as illustrated in W. C. Borlase's sumptuous volumes<a name="FNanchor_1259_1259" id="FNanchor_1259_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1259_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a>, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
a perpetual wonder, but is rendered less inexplicable if we
assume an immense duration of the New Stone Age in the
British Isles. The Irish dolmen-builders were presumably of
the same long-headed stock as those of Britain<a name="FNanchor_1260_1260" id="FNanchor_1260_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a>, and they were
followed by Celtic-speaking Goidels who may have come
directly from the continent<a name="FNanchor_1261_1261" id="FNanchor_1261_1261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1261_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a>, and there is evidence in Ptolemy
and elsewhere of the presence of Brythonic tribes from Gaul
in the east. Since these early historic times the intruders have
been almost exclusively of Teutonic race, and Viking invaders
from Norway and Denmark founded the earliest towns such
as Dublin, Waterford and Limerick. Now all alike, save for
an almost insignificant and rapidly dwindling minority, have
assumed the speech of the English and Lowland Scotch
intruders, who began to arrive late in the 12th century, and
are now chiefly massed in Ulster, Leinster, and all the large
towns. The rich and highly poetic Irish language has a
copious medieval literature of the utmost importance to
students of European origins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relations in
Scotland.</div>

<p>In Scotland few ethnical changes or displacements have
occurred since the colonisation of portions of the west by
Gaelic-speaking Scottic tribes from Ireland, and
the English (Angle) occupation of the Lothians.
The Grampians have during historic times formed
the main ethnical divide between the two elements, and brooklets
which can be taken at a leap are shown where the opposite
banks have for hundreds of years been respectively held by
formerly hostile, but now friendly communities of Gaelic and
broad Scotch speech.  Here the chief intruders have been
Scandinavians, whose descendants may still be recognised in
Caithness, the Hebrides, and the Orkney and Shetland groups.
Faint echoes of the old Norrena tongue are said still to linger
amongst the sturdy Shetlanders, whose assimilation to the
dominant race began only after their transfer from Norway to
the Crown of Scotland.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span></p>

<p>Since 1901 the researches of Gray and Tocher<a name="FNanchor_1262_1262" id="FNanchor_1262_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1262_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a> on the
pigmentation of some 500,000 school children of Scotland
have increased our information as to racial distribution. The
average percentage of boys with fair hair is nearly 25 for the
whole of the country, and when this is compared with 82 in
Schleswig Holstein "we are driven to the conclusion that the
pure Norse or Anglo-Saxon element in our population is by
no means predominant. There is evidently also a dark or
brunette element which is at least equal in amount and
probably greater than that of the Norse element" (p. 380).
Pure blue eyes for the whole of Scotland average 14.7 per
cent., which may be compared with 42.9 in Prussia. The
greatest density for fair hair and eyes is to be found in the
great river valleys opening on to the German Ocean, and also
in the Western Isles. The Tweed, Forth, Tay and Don all
show indications of settlements of a blonde race "probably due
to Anglo-Saxon invasions," but the maximum is to be found
at the mouth of the Spey. The high percentage here and in
the Hebrides and opposite coasts, the authors trace to Viking
invasions. The percentage of dark hair for boys and girls is
25.2 as compared with 1.3 in Prussian school children, the
maximum density as we should expect being in the west. Jet
black hair (1.2%) has its maximum density in the central
highlands and wild west coast. Beddoe<a name="FNanchor_1263_1263" id="FNanchor_1263_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a> commenting on Gray
and Tocher's results calculates an even higher percentage of
black hair (over 2%) "either within or astride of the Highland
frontier. Except Paisley, there is not a single instance south
of the Forth, nor one between the Spey and the Firth of Tay.
Surely there is something 'racial' here." Beddoe's map,
constructed from Gray and Tocher's statistics, clearly indicates
the distribution of racial types.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And in
Wales.</div>

<p>The work carried on in Wales for a number of years by
H. J. Fleure and T. C. James<a name="FNanchor_1264_1264" id="FNanchor_1264_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a> has produced some extremely
interesting results. The chief types (based on
measurements and observations of head, face,
nose, skin, hair and eye colour, stature, etc.) fall
into the following groups.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span></p>

<p>1. "The fundamental type is certainly the long-headed
brunet of the moorlands and their inland valleys. He is universally
recognised as belonging to the Mediterranean race of
Sergi and as dating back in this country to early Neolithic
times." The cephalic index is about 78, with high colouring,
dark hair and eyes, and stature rather below the average. A
possible mixture of earlier stocks is shown in a longer-headed
type (c.i. about 75), with well-marked occiput, very dark hair
and eyes, swarthy complexion, and average stature (about
1690 mm. = 5 ft. 6&frac12; ins.). Occasionally in North Wales the
occurrence of lank black hair, a sallow complexion and
prominent cheekbones suggests a "Mongoloid" type; and a
type with small stature, black, closely curled hair and a rather
broad nose has negroid reminiscences. The Plynlymon
moorlands contain a "nest" of extreme dolichocephaly and an
unusually high percentage of red hair.</p>

<p>2. Nordic-Alpine type, with cephalic index mainly between
76 and 81. This group includes (<i>a</i>) a "local version of the
Nordic type" occurring at Newcastle Emlyn and in South and
South-West Pembrokeshire with fair hair and eyes, usually
tall stature and great strength of brow, jaw and chin; (<i>b</i>) a
heavier variant on the Welsh border, often with cephalic index
above 80, and extremely tall stature; (<i>c</i>) the Borreby or
Beaker-Maker type, broad-headed and short-faced with darker
pigmentation, probably a cross between Alpine and Nordic,
characteristic of the long cleft from Corwen <i>via</i> Bala to Tabyllyn
and Towyn.</p>

<p>3. Dark bullet-headed short thick-set men of the general
type denoted by the term Alpine or more exactly perhaps by
the term Cevenole are found, though not commonly, in North
Montgomeryshire valleys.</p>

<p>4. Powerfully built, often intensely dark, broad-headed,
broad-faced, strong and square jawed men are characteristic
of the Ardudwy coast, the South Glamorgan coast, Newquay
district (Cardiganshire) and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The authors observe that Type 1 with its variations contributes
"considerable numbers to the ministries of the various
churches, possibly in part from inherent and racial leanings,
but partly also because these are the people of the moorlands.
The idealism of such people usually expresses itself in music,
poetry, literature and religion rather than in architecture,
painting and plastic arts generally. They rarely have a suffi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>ciency
of material resources for the latter activities. These
types also contribute a number of men to the medical profession....
The successful commercial men, who have given the
Welsh their extraordinarily prominent place in British trade
(shipping firms for example) usually belong to types 2 or 4,
rather than to 1, as also do the majority of Welsh members of
Parliament, though there are exceptions of the first importance.
The Nordic type is marked by ingenuity and enterprise in
striking out new lines. Type 2 (<i>c</i>) in Wales is remarkable for
governmental ability of the administrative kind as well as for
independence of thought and critical power" (p. 119).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Present Constitution
of
the British
Peoples.</div>

<p>We have now all the elements needed to unravel the
ethnical tangle of the present inhabitants of the British Isles.
The astonishing prevalence everywhere of the
moderately dolicho heads is at once explained by
the absence of brachy immigrants except in the
Bronze period, and these could do no more than
raise the cephalic index from about 70 or 72 to the present
mean of about 78. With the other perhaps less stable characters
the case is not always quite so simple. The brunettes,
representing the Mediterranean type, certainly increase, as we
should expect, from north-east to south-west, though even here
there is a considerable dark patch, due to local causes, in the
home shires about London<a name="FNanchor_1265_1265" id="FNanchor_1265_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a>. But the stature, almost everywhere
a troublesome factor, seems to wander somewhat
lawlessly over the land.</p>

<p>Although a short stature more or less coincides with
brunetteness in England and Wales, and the observations in
Ireland are too few to be relied on, no such parallelism can be
traced in Scotland. The west (Inverness and Argyllshire),
though as dark as South Wales, shows an average stature of
1.73 m. to 1.74 m. (5 ft. 8 ins. to 5 ft. 8&frac12; ins.), which is higher than
the average for the whole of Britain. And South-west Scotland,
where the type is fairly dark, contains the tallest population
in Europe, if not in the world. Ripley suggests either that
"some ethnic element of which no pure trace remains, served
to increase the stature of the western Highlanders without at
the same time conducing to blondness; or else some local
influences of natural selection or environment are responsible
for it<a name="FNanchor_1266_1266" id="FNanchor_1266_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1266_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a>"; and he hints also that the linguistic distinction between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>

variation.</p>

<p>The English tongue need not detain us long. Its qualities,

Grimm the title of <i>Welt-Sprache</i>, the "World

Low German division of the Teutonic branch of the Aryan family.

connection in its inner structure, which reveals not a trace of
Neo-Latin influences. The phonetic system has undergone
profound changes, which can be only indirectly and to a small
extent due to French action. What English owes to French
and Latin is a very large number, many thousands, of words,
some superadded to, some superseding their Saxon equivalents,
but altogether immensely increasing its wealth of expression,
while giving it a transitional position between the somewhat
sharply contrasted Germanic and Romance worlds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The French
Nation.</div>

<p>Amongst the Romance peoples, that is, the French,
Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians, Rumanians, many Swiss and
Belgians, who were entirely assimilated in speech
and largely in their civil institutions to their
Roman masters, the paramount position, a sort of
international hegemony, has been taken by the French nation
since the decadence of Spain under the feeble successors of
Philip II. The constituent elements of these Gallo-Romans,
as they may be called, are much the same as those of the
British peoples, but differ in their distribution and relative
proportions. Thus the Iberians (Aquitani, Pictones, and later
Vascones), who may perhaps be identified with the neolithic
long-heads<a name="FNanchor_1268_1268" id="FNanchor_1268_1268"></a><a href="#Footnote_1268_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a>, do not appear ever to have ranged much farther
north than Brittany, and were Aryanised in pre-Roman times
by the P-speaking Celts everywhere north of the Garonne.
The prehistoric Teutons again, who had advanced beyond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
the Rhine at an early period (Caesar says <i>antiquitus</i>) into
the present Belgium, were mainly confined to the northern
provinces. Even the historic Teutons (chiefly Franks and
Burgundians) penetrated little beyond the Seine in the north
and the present Burgundy in the east, while the Vandals,
Visigoths and a few others passed rapidly through to Iberia
beyond the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>Thus the greater part of the land, say from the Seine-Marne
basin to the Mediterranean, continued to be held by
the Romanised mass of Alpine type throughout all the central
and most of the southern provinces, and elsewhere in the
south by the Romanised long-headed Mediterranean type.
This great preponderance of the Romanised Alpine masses
explains the rapid absorption of the Teutonic intruders, who
were all, except the Fleming section of the Belgae, completely
assimilated to the Gallo-Romans before the close of the tenth
century. It also explains the perhaps still more remarkable
fact that the Norsemen who settled (912) under Rollo in
Normandy were all practically Frenchmen when a few generations
later they followed their Duke William to the conquest
of Saxon England. Thus the only intractable groups have
proved to be the Basques<a name="FNanchor_1269_1269" id="FNanchor_1269_1269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1269_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a> and the Bretons, both of whom to
this day retain their speech in isolated corners of the country.
With these exceptions the whole of France, save the debateable
area of Alsace-Lorraine, presents in its speech a certain
homogeneous character, the standard language (<i>langue d'oil</i><a name="FNanchor_1270_1270" id="FNanchor_1270_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_1270_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a>)
being current throughout all the northern and central provinces,
while it is steadily gaining upon the southern form (<i>langue
d'oc</i><a href="#Footnote_1270_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a>) still surviving in the rural districts of Limousin and
Provence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mental Traits.</div>

<p>But pending a more thorough fusion of such tenacious
elements as Basques, Bretons, Auvergnats, and Savoyards, we
can scarcely yet speak of a common French type,
but only of a common nationality. Tall stature,
long skulls, fair or light brown colour, grey or blue eyes, still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
prevail, as might be expected, in the north, these being traits
common alike to the prehistoric Belgae, the Franks of the
Merovingian and Carlovingian empires, and Rollo's Norsemen.
With these contrast the southern peoples of short stature,
olive-brown skin, round heads, dark brown or black eyes and
hair. The tendency towards uniformity has proceeded far
more rapidly in the urban than in the rural districts. Hence
the citizens of Paris, Lyons, Bordeaux, Marseilles and other
large towns, present fewer and less striking contrasts than
the natives of the old historical provinces, where are still
distinguished the loquacious and mendacious Gascon, the
pliant and versatile Basque, the slow and wary Norman, the
dreamy and fanatical Breton, the quick and enterprising
Burgundian, and the bright, intelligent, more even-tempered
native of Touraine, a typical Frenchman occupying the heart
of the land, and holding, as it were, the balance between all
the surrounding elements.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Spaniards and
Portuguese.</div>

<p>In Spain and Portugal we have again the same ethnological
elements, but also again in different proportions and differently
distributed, with others superadded&mdash;proto-Phoenicians
and later Phoenicians (Carthaginians),
Romans, Visigoths, Vandals, and still later Berbers
and Arabs. Here the Celtic-speaking mixed peoples
mingled in prehistoric times with the long-headed Mediterraneans,
an ethnical fusion known to the ancients, who labelled
it "Keltiberian<a name="FNanchor_1271_1271" id="FNanchor_1271_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_1271_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a>." But, as in Britain, the other intruders
were mostly long-heads, with the striking result that the
Peninsula presents to-day exactly the same uniform cranial
type as the British Isles. Even the range (76 to 79) and the
mean (78) of the cephalic index are the same, rising in Spain
to 80 only in the Basque corner. As Ripley states, "the
average cephalic index of 78 occurs nowhere else so uniformly
distributed in Europe" except in Norway, and this
uniformity "is the concomitant and index of two relatively
pure, albeit widely different, ethnic types&mdash;Mediterranean in
Spain, Teutonic in Norway<a name="FNanchor_1272_1272" id="FNanchor_1272_1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1272_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Provincial
Groups.</div>

<p>In other respects the social, one might almost say the
national, groups are both more numerous and perhaps even
more sharply discriminated in the Peninsula
than in France.  Besides the Basques and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
Portuguese, the latter with a considerable strain of negro
blood<a name="FNanchor_1273_1273" id="FNanchor_1273_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1273_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a>, we have such very distinct populations as the haughty
and punctilious Castilians, who under an outward show of
pride and honour, are capable of much meanness; the sprightly
and vainglorious Andalusians, who have been called the
Gascons of Spain, yet of graceful address and seductive
manners; the morose and impassive Murcians, indolent because
fatalists; the gay Valencians given to much dancing and revelry,
but also to sudden fits of murderous rage, holding life so cheap
that they will hire themselves out as assassins, and cut their
bread with the blood-stained knife of their last victim; the
dull and superstitious Aragonese, also given to bloodshed,
and so obdurate that they are said to "drive nails in with
their heads"; lastly the Catalans, noisy and quarrelsome, but
brave, industrious, and enterprising, on the whole the best
element in this motley aggregate of unbalanced temperaments.
The various aspects of Spanish temperament are regarded by
Havelock Ellis<a name="FNanchor_1274_1274" id="FNanchor_1274_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a> as manifestations of an aboriginally primitive
race, which, under the stress of a peculiarly stimulating and
yet hardening environment, has retained through every stage
of development an unusual degree of the endowment of fresh
youth, of elemental savagery, with which it started. This
explains the fine qualities of Spain and her defects, the
splendid initiative, and lack of sustained ability to carry it out,
the importance of the point of honour and the glorification of
the primitive virtue of valour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethnic Relations
in Italy.</div>

<p>In Italy the past and present relations, as elucidated especially
by Livi and Sergi, may be thus briefly stated. After the
first Stone Age, of which there are fewer indications
than might be expected<a name="FNanchor_1275_1275" id="FNanchor_1275_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a>, the whole land
was thickly settled by dark long-headed Mediterranean
peoples in neolithic times. These were later joined
by Pelasgians of like type from Greece, and by Illyrians
of doubtful affinity from the Balkan Peninsula. Indeed C.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
Penka<a name="FNanchor_1276_1276" id="FNanchor_1276_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1276_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a>, who has so many paradoxical theories, makes the
Illyrians the first inhabitants of Italy, as shown by the striking
resemblance of the <i>terramara</i> culture of Aemilia with that of
the Venetian and Laibach pile-dwellings. The recent finds in
Bosnia also<a name="FNanchor_1277_1277" id="FNanchor_1277_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1277_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a>, besides the historically proved (?) migration of
the Siculi from Upper Italy to Sicily, and their Illyrian origin,
all point in the same direction. But the facts are differently
interpreted by Sergi<a name="FNanchor_1278_1278" id="FNanchor_1278_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a>, who holds that the whole land was
occupied by the Mediterraneans, because we find even in
Switzerland pile-dwellers of the same type<a name="FNanchor_1279_1279" id="FNanchor_1279_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a>.</p>

<p>Then came the peoples of Aryan speech, Celtic-speaking
Alpines from the north-west and Slavs from the north-east,
who raised the cephalic index in the north, where the brachy
element, as already seen, still greatly predominates but
diminishes steadily southwards<a name="FNanchor_1280_1280" id="FNanchor_1280_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a>. They occupied the whole
of Umbria, which at first stretched across the peninsula from
the Adriatic to the Mediterranean, but was later encroached
upon by the intruding Etruscans on the west side. Then also
some of these Umbrians, migrating southwards to Latium
beyond the Tiber, intermingled, says Sergi, with the Italic
(Ligurian) aborigines, and became the founders of the Roman
state<a name="FNanchor_1281_1281" id="FNanchor_1281_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a>. With the spread of the Roman arms the Latin language,
which Sergi claims to be a kind of Aryanised Ligurian, but
must be regarded as a true member of the Aryan family, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
diffused throughout the whole of the peninsula and islands,
sweeping away all traces not only of the original Ligurian and
other Mediterranean tongues, but also of Etruscan and its
own sister languages, such as Umbrian, Oscan, and Sabellian.</p>

<p>At the fall of the empire the land was overrun by Ostrogoths,
Heruli, and other Teutons, none of whom formed permanent
settlements except the Longobards, who gave their name to
the present Lombardy, but were themselves rapidly assimilated
in speech and general culture to the surrounding populations,
whom we may now call Italians in the modern sense of the
term.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arts and
Ethics.</div>

<p>When it is remembered that the Aegean culture had spread
to Italy at an early date, that it was continued under
Hellenic influences by Etruscans and Umbrians,
that Greek arts and letters were planted on
Italian soil (<i>Magna Graecia</i>) before the foundation
of Rome, that all these civilisations converged in Rome itself
and were thence diffused throughout the West, that the
traditions of previous cultural epochs never died out, acquired
new life with the Renascence and were thus perpetuated to
the present day, it may be claimed for the gifted Italian people
that they have been for a longer period than any others under
the unbroken sway of general humanising influences.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Rumanians.</div>

<p>These "Latin Peoples," as they are called because they
all speak languages of the Latin stock, are not confined to
the West. To the Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese,
with the less known and ruder Walloon
of Belgium and Romansch of Switzerland, Tyrol,
and Friuli, must be associated the <i>Rumanian</i> current amongst
some nine millions of so-called "Daco-Rumanians" in Moldavia
and Wallachia, <i>i.e.</i> the modern kingdom of Rumania. The
same Neo-Latin tongue is also spoken by the <i>Tsintsars</i> or
<i>Kutzo-Vlacks</i><a name="FNanchor_1282_1282" id="FNanchor_1282_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a> of the Mount Pindus districts in the Balkan
Peninsula, and by numerous Rumanians who have in later
times migrated into Hungary. They form a compact and
vigorous nationality, who claim direct descent from the Roman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
military colonists settled north of the Lower Danube by Trajan
after his conquest of the Dacians (107 <small>A.D.</small>). But great
difficulties attach to this theory, which is rejected by many
ethnologists, especially on the ground that, after Trajan's
time, Dacia was repeatedly swept clean by the Huns, the
Finns, the Avars, Magyars and other rude Mongolo-Turki
hordes, besides many almost ruder Slavic peoples during the
many centuries when the eastern populations were in a state
of continual flux after the withdrawal of the Roman legionaries
from the Lower Danube. Besides, it is shown by Roesler<a name="FNanchor_1283_1283" id="FNanchor_1283_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a>
and others that under Aurelian (257 <small>A.D.</small>) Trajan's colonists
withdrew bodily southwards to and beyond the Hemus to the
territory of the old Bessi (Thracians), <i>i.e.</i> the district still
occupied by the Macedo-Rumanians. But in the 13th century,
during the break-up of the Byzantine empire, most of these
fugitives were again driven north to their former seats beyond
the Danube, where they have ever since held their ground,
and constituted themselves a distinct and far from feeble
branch of the Neo-Latin community. The Pindus, therefore,
rather than the Carpathians, is to be taken as the last area of
dispersion of these valiant and intelligent descendants of the
Daco-Romans. This seems the most rational solution of
what A. D. Xenopol calls "an historic enigma," although he
himself rejects Roesler's conclusions in favour of the old view
so dear to the national pride of the present Rumanian people<a name="FNanchor_1284_1284" id="FNanchor_1284_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a>.
The composite character of the Rumanian language&mdash;fundamentally
Neo-Latin or rather early Italian, with strong Illyrian
(Albanian) and Slav affinities&mdash;would almost imply that Dacia
had never been Romanised under the empire, and that in fact
this region was <i>for the first time</i> occupied by its present
Romance speaking inhabitants in the 13th century<a name="FNanchor_1285_1285" id="FNanchor_1285_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a>. The
nomadic life of the Rumanians is in itself, as Peisker points
out<a name="FNanchor_1286_1286" id="FNanchor_1286_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a>, a refutation of their descent from settled Roman colonists,
and indicates a Central Asiatic origin. The mounted nomads
grazed during the summer "on most of the mountains of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
Balkan peninsula, and took up their winter quarters on the
sea-coasts among a peasant population speaking a different
language. Thence they gradually spread, unnoticed by the
chroniclers, along all the mountain ranges, over all the
Carpathians of Transylvania, North Hungary, and South
Galicia, to Moravia; towards the north-west from Montenegro
onwards over Herzegovina, Bosnia, Istria, as far as South
Styria; towards the south over Albania far into Greece.... And
like the peasantry among which they wintered (and winter)
long enough, they became (and become) after a transitory bilingualism,
Greeks, Albanians, Servians, Bulgarians, Ruthenians,
Poles, Slovaks, Chekhs, Slovenes, Croatians ... a mobile nomad
stratum among a strange-tongued and more numerous peasant
element, and not till later did they gradually take to agriculture
and themselves become settled."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethnic Relations
in
Greece.</div>

<p>The Pelasgians and Minoan civilisation have been briefly discussed
above (Ch. XIII.). Later problems in Greek ethnology
are still under dispute. Sergi, who regards the proto-Aryans
as round-headed barbarians of Celtic,
Slav, and Teutonic speech, makes no exception in
favour of the Hellenes. These also enter Greece not as civilisers,
but rather as destroyers of the flourishing Mykenaean culture
developed here, as in Italy, by the Mediterranean aborigines.
But in course of time the intruders become absorbed in the
Pelasgic or eastern branch of the Mediterraneans, and what
we call Hellenism is really Pelasgianism revived, and to some
extent modified by the Aryan (Hellenic) element.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hellenes.</div>

<p>If it may be allowed that at their advent the Hellenes were
less civilised than the native Aegeans on whom they imposed
their Aryan speech, whence and when came they?
By Penka<a name="FNanchor_1287_1287" id="FNanchor_1287_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a>, for whom the Baltic lands would be
the original home not merely of the Germanic branch but of
all the Aryans, the Hellenic cradle is located in the Oder basin
between the Elbe and the Vistula. As the Doric, doubtless
the last Greek irruption into Hellas, is chronologically fixed
at 1149 <small>B.C.</small>, the beginning of the Hellenic migrations may be
dated back to the 13th century. When the Hellenes migrated
from Central Europe to Greece, the period of the general
ethnic dispersion was already closed, and the migratory period
which next followed began with the Hellenes, and was continued
by the Itali, Gauls, Germans, etc. The difficulties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
created by this view are insurmountable. Thus we should
have to suppose that from this relatively contracted Aryan
cradle countless tribes swarmed over Europe since the 13th
century <small>B.C.</small>, speaking profoundly different languages (Greek,
Celtic, Latin, etc.), all differentiated since that time on the
shores of the Baltic. The proto-Aryans with their already
specialised tongues had reached the shores of the Mediterranean
long before that time and, according to Maspero<a name="FNanchor_1288_1288" id="FNanchor_1288_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a>, were known
to the Egyptians of the 5th dynasty (3990-3804 <small>B.C.</small>) if not
earlier. Allowing that these may have rather been pre-Hellenes
(Pelasgians), we still know that the Achaeans had
traditionally arrived about 1250 <small>B.C.</small> and they were already
speaking the language of Homer.</p>

<p>"The indications of archaeology and of legend agree
marvellously well with those of the Egyptian records," says
H. R. Hall<a name="FNanchor_1289_1289" id="FNanchor_1289_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1289_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a>, "in making the Third Late Minoan period one
of incessant disturbance.... The whole basin of the Eastern
Mediterranean seems to have been a seething turmoil of
migrations, expulsions, wars and piracies, started first by the
Mycenaean (Achaian) conquest of Crete, and then intensified
by the constant impulse of the Northern iron-users into
Greece." Herodotus speaks of the great invasion of the
Thesprotian tribes from beyond Pindus, which took place
probably in the 13th century <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_1290_1290" id="FNanchor_1290_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a> As a result "an overwhelming
Aryan and iron-using population was first brought
into Greece. The earlier Achaian (?) tribes of Aryans in
Thessaly, who had perhaps lived there from time immemorial,
and had probably already infiltrated southwards to form the
mixed Ionian population about the Isthmus, were scattered, only
a small portion of the nation remaining in its original home,
while of the rest part conquered the South and another part
emigrated across the sea to the Phrygian coast. Of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
emigration to Asia the first event must have been the war of
Troy.... The Boeotian and Achaian invasion of the South
scattered the Minyae, Pelasgians, and Ionians. The remnant
of the Minyae emigrated to Lemnos, the Pelasgi and Ionians
were concentrated in Attica and another body of Ionians in
the later Achaia, while the Southern Achaeans pressed forward
into the Peloponnese<a name="FNanchor_1291_1291" id="FNanchor_1291_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Greek
Language.</div>

<p>It is evident from the national traditions that the proto-Greeks
did not arrive <i>en bloc</i>, but rather at intervals in separate
and often hostile bands bearing different names. But all these
groups&mdash;Achaeans, Danai, Argians, Dolopes, Myrmidons,
Leleges and many others, some of which were also found in
Asia Minor&mdash;retained a strong sense of their common origin.
The sentiment, which may be called racial rather than national,
received ultimate expression when to all of them was extended
the collective name of Hellenes (Sellenes originally), that is,
descendants of Deucalion's son Hellen, whose two sons Aeolus
and Dorus, and grandson Ion, were supposed to be the progenitors
of the Aeolians, Dorians, and Ionians. But such
traditions are merely reminiscences of times when the tribal
groupings still prevailed, and it may be taken for granted that
the three main branches of the Hellenic stock did not spring
from a particular family that rose to power in comparatively
recent times in the Thessalian district of Phthiotis. Whatever
truth may lie behind the Hellenic legend, it is highly probable
that, at the time when Hellen is said to have flourished (about
1500 B.C.), the Aeolic-speaking communities of Thessaly,
Arcadia, Boeotia, the closely-allied Dorians<a name="FNanchor_1292_1292" id="FNanchor_1292_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a>
of Phocaea, Argos, and Laconia, and the Ionians of Attica, had already been clearly
specialised, had in fact formed special groups before entering Greece.
Later their dialects, after acquiring a certain polish and leaving
some imperishable records of the many-sided Greek genius, were gradually
merged in the literary Neo-Ionic or Attic, which thus became the
<span class = "greek" title = "koin&ecirc; dialektos">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#942; &#948;&#953;&#940;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>,
or current speech of the Greek world.</p>

<p>Admirable alike for its manifold aptitudes and surprising
vitality, the language of Aeschylus, Thucydides, and the
other great Athenians outlived all the vicissitudes of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
Byzantine empire, during which it was for a time banished
from Southern Greece, and even still survives, although in a
somewhat degraded form, in the Romaic or Neo-Hellenic
tongue of modern Hellas. Romaic, a name which recalls a
time when the Byzantines were known as "Romans" throughout
the East, differs far less from the classical standard than
do any of the Romance tongues from Latin. Since the restoration
of Greek independence great efforts have been made
to revive the old language in all its purity, and some modern
writers now compose in a style differing little from that of the
classic period.</p>

<p>Yet the Hellenic race itself has almost perished on the
mainland. Traces of the old Greek type have been detected
by Lenormant and others, especially amongst the women of
Patras and Missolonghi. But within living memory Attica
was still an Albanian land, and Fallmerayer has conclusively
shown that the Peloponnesus and adjacent districts had become
thoroughly Slavonised during the 6th and 7th centuries<a name="FNanchor_1293_1293" id="FNanchor_1293_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a>.
"For many centuries," writes the careful Roesler, "the Greek
peninsula served as a colonial domain for the Slavs, receiving
the overflow of their population from the Sarmatian lowlands<a name="FNanchor_1294_1294" id="FNanchor_1294_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a>."
Their presence is betrayed in numerous geographical terms,
such as <i>Varsova</i> in Arcadia, <i>Glogova</i>, <i>Tsilikhova</i>, etc. Nevertheless,
since the revival of the Hellenic sentiment there has
been a steady flow of Greek immigration from the Archipelago
and Anatolia; and the Albanian, Slav, Italian, Turkish,
Rumanian, and Norman elements have in modern Greece
already become almost completely Hellenised, at least in speech.
Of the old dialects Doric alone appears to have survived in the
Tsaconic of the Laconian hills. The Greek language has,
however, disappeared from Southern Italy, Sicily, Syria, and
the greater part of Egypt and Asia Minor, where it was long
dominant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Slavs.</div>

<p>To understand the appearance of <span class="smcap">Slavs</span> in the Peloponnesus
we must go back to the Eurasian steppe, the probable cradle of
these multitudinous populations. Here they have
often been confused with the ancient Sarmatae,
who already before the dawn of history were in possession of
the South Russian plains between the Scythians towards the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
east and the proto-Germanic tribes before their migration to
the Baltic lands. But even at that time, before the close of the
Neolithic Age, there must have been interminglings, if not with
the western Teutons, almost certainly with the eastern Scythians,
which helps to explain the generally vague character of the references
made by classical writers both to the Sarmatians and the
Scythians, who sometimes seem to be indistinguishable from
savage Mongol hordes, and at others are represented as semi-cultured
peoples, such as the Aryans of the Bronze period might
have been round about the district of Olbia and the other early
Miletian settlements on the northern shores of the Euxine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sarmatians.</div>

<p>Owing to these early crossings Andr&eacute; Lef&egrave;vre goes so far
as to say that "there is no Slav race<a name="FNanchor_1295_1295" id="FNanchor_1295_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a>," but only nations of
divers more or less pure types, more or less crossed, speaking
dialects of the same language, who later received the name of
Slavs, borne by a prehistoric tribe of <i>Sarmatians</i>, and meaning
"renowned," "illustrious<a name="FNanchor_1296_1296" id="FNanchor_1296_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a>." Both their language and mythologies,
continues Lef&egrave;vre, point to the vast region near Irania
as the primeval home of the Slav, as of the Celtic and Germanic
populations. The Sauromatae or Sarmatae of Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_1297_1297" id="FNanchor_1297_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a>, who
had given their name to the mass of Slav or Slavonised peoples,
still dwelt north of the Caucasus and south of the <i>Budini</i>
between the Caspian, the Don and Sea of Azov; "after
crossing the Tanais (Don) we are no longer in
Scythia; we begin to enter the lands of the
Sauromatae, who, starting from the angle of the
Palus Moeotis (Sea of Azov), occupy a space of 15 days' march,
where are neither trees, fruit-trees, nor savages. Above the
tract fallen to them the Budini occupy another district, which
is overgrown with all kinds of trees<a name="FNanchor_1298_1298" id="FNanchor_1298_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a>." Then Herodotus
seems to identify these Sarmatians with the Scythians,
whence all the subsequent doubts and confusion. Both spoke
the same language, of which seven distinct dialects are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
mentioned, yet a number of personal names preserved by the
Greeks have a certain Iranic look, so that these Scythian
tongues seem to have been really Aryan, forming a transition
between the Asiatic and the European branches of the family.</p>

<p>The probable explanation is that the Scythians<a name="FNanchor_1299_1299" id="FNanchor_1299_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a> were a
horde which came down from Upper Asia, conquered an
Iranian-speaking people, and in time adopted the speech of its
subjects. E. H. Minns<a name="FNanchor_1300_1300" id="FNanchor_1300_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a> suggests that the settled Scythians
represent the remains of the Iranian population, and the nomads
the conquering peoples. These were displaced later by the
Sarmatians, and Scythia becomes merely a geographical term.
Skulls dug up in Scythic graves throw no light on racial
affinities, some being long, and some short, but in customs
there is a close analogy with the Mongols, though, as Minns
points out, "the natural conditions of steppe-ranging dictated
the greater part of them."</p>

<p>Both Slav and Germanic tribes had probably in remote
times penetrated up the Danube and the Volga, while some
of the former under the name of <i>Wends</i> (Venedi<a name="FNanchor_1301_1301" id="FNanchor_1301_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a>), appear to
have reached the Carpathians and the Baltic shores down the
Vistula. The movement was continued far into medieval
times, when great overlappings took place, and when numerous
Slav tribes, some still known as Wends, others as <i>Sorbs</i>, <i>Croats</i>,
or <i>Chekhs</i>, ranged over Central Europe to Pomerania and beyond
the Upper Elbe to Suabia. Most of these have long been Teutonised,
but a few of the <i>Polabs</i><a name="FNanchor_1302_1302" id="FNanchor_1302_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a> survive as Wends in Prussian
and Saxon Lausatz, while the Chekhs and <i>Slovaks</i> still hold
their ground in Bohemia and Moravia, as the <i>Poles</i> do in
Posen and the Vistula valley, and the <i>Rusniaks</i> or <i>Ruthenes</i>
with the closely allied "Little Russians," in the Carpathians,
Galicia, and Ukrania.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Southern
Slavs.</div>

<p>It was from the Carpathian<a name="FNanchor_1303_1303" id="FNanchor_1303_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a> lands that came those <i>Yugo-Slavs</i>
("Southern Slavs") who, under the collective name of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>Sorbs (Serbs, Servians), moved southwards beyond the
Danube, and overran a great part of the Balkan
peninsula and nearly the whole of Greece in the
6th and 7th centuries. They were the Khorvats<a name="FNanchor_1304_1304" id="FNanchor_1304_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a>
or Khrobats<a href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a> from the upland valleys of the Oder and Vistula,
whom, after his Persian wars, Heraclius invited to settle in
the wasted provinces south of the Danube, hoping, as Nadir
Shah did later with the Kurds in Khorasan, to make them a
northern bulwark of the empire against the incursions of the
Avars and other Mongolo-Turki hordes. Thus was formed
the first permanent settlement of the Yugo-Slavs in Croatia,
Istria, Dalmatia, Bosnia, and the Nerenta valley in 680, under
the five brothers Klukas, Lobol, Kosentses, M&uacute;kl, and Khrobat,
with their sisters Tuga and Buga. These were followed by
the kindred Srp (Sorb) tribes from the Elbe, who left their
homes in Misnia and Lusatia, and received as their patrimony
the whole region between Macedonia and Epirus, Dardania,
Upper Moesia, the Dacia of Aurelian, and Illyria, <i>i.e.</i> Bosnia
and Servia. The lower Danube was at the same time occupied
by the <i>Severenses</i>, "Seven Nations," also Slavs, who reached
to the foot of the Hemus beyond the present Varna. Nothing
could stem this great Slav inundation, which soon overflowed
into Macedonia (Rumelia), Thessaly, and Peloponnesus, so
that for a time nearly the whole of the Balkan lands, from the
Danube to the Mediterranean, became a Slav domain&mdash;parts
of Illyria and Epirus (Albania) with the Greek districts about
Constantinople alone excepted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Albanians.</div>

<p>Hellas, as above seen, has recovered itself, and the
<i>Albanians</i><a name="FNanchor_1305_1305" id="FNanchor_1305_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a>, direct descendants of the ancient Illyrians, still
hold their ground and keep alive the last echoes
of the old Illyrian language, which was almost
certainly a proto-Aryan form of speech probably intermediate,
as above-mentioned, between the Italic and Hellenic branches.
They even retain the old tribal system, so that there are not
only two main sections, the northern <i>Ghegs</i> and the southern
<i>Toshks</i>, but each section is divided into a number of minor
groups<a name="FNanchor_1306_1306" id="FNanchor_1306_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a>, such as the Malliesors (Klementi, Pulati, Hoti, etc.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
and Mirdites (Dibri, Fandi, Matia, etc.) in the north, and the
Toxides (whence Toshk) and the Yapides (Lapides) in the
south. The southerners are mainly Orthodox Greeks, and in
other respects half-Hellenised Epirotes, the northerners partly
Moslem and partly Roman Catholics of the Latin rite. From
this section came chiefly those Albanians who, after the death
(1467) of their valiant champion, George Castriota (<i>Scanderbeg</i>,
"Alexander the Great"), fled from Turkish oppression and
formed numerous settlements, especially in Calabria and Sicily,
and still retain their national traditions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Russians.</div>

<p>In their original homes, located by some between the Bug
and the Dnieper, the Slavs have not only recovered from the
fierce Mongolo-Turki and Finn tornadoes, by
which the eastern steppes were repeatedly swept
for over 1500 years after the building of the Great Wall, but
have in recent historic times displayed a prodigious power of
expansion second only to that of the British peoples. The
<i>Russians</i> (Great, Little, and White Russians), whose political
empire now stretches continuously from the Baltic to the
Pacific, have already absorbed nearly all the Mongol elements
in East Europe, have founded compact settlements in Caucasia
and West Siberia, and have thrown off numerous pioneer
groups of colonists along all the highways of trade and
migration, and down the great fluvial arteries between the
Ob and the Amur estuary. They number collectively over
100 millions, with a domain of some nine million square miles.
The majority belong to Deniker's Eastern race<a name="FNanchor_1307_1307" id="FNanchor_1307_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a> (a variety of
the Alpine type), being blond, sub-brachycephalic and short,
1.64 m. (5 ft. 4&frac12; ins.). The Little Russians in the South on the
Black Mould belt are more brachycephalic and have darker
colouring and taller stature. The White Russians in the West
between Poland and Lithuania are the fairest of all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Russian
Origins.</div>

<p>We need not be detained by the controversy carried on
between Sergi and Zaborowski regarding a prehistoric spread
of the Mediterranean race to Russia<a name="FNanchor_1308_1308" id="FNanchor_1308_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a>. The skulls
from several of the old Kurgans, identified by
Sergi with his Mediterranean type, have not been
sufficiently determined as to date or cultural periods to decide
the question, while their dolicho shape is common both to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
Mediterraneans and to the proto-Aryans of the North European
type<a name="FNanchor_1309_1309" id="FNanchor_1309_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a>. To this stock the proto-Slavs are affiliated by
Zaborowski and many others<a name="FNanchor_1310_1310" id="FNanchor_1310_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a>, although the present Slavs are
all distinctly round-headed. Ripley asks, almost in despair,
what is to be done with the present Slav element, and decides
to apply "the term <i>Homo Alpinus</i> to this broad-headed group
wherever it occurs, whether on mountains or plains, in the
west or in the east<a name="FNanchor_1311_1311" id="FNanchor_1311_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Ossets.</div>

<p>We are beset by the same difficulties as we pass with the
<i>Ossets</i> of the Caucasus into the Iranian and Indian domains of
the proto-Aryan peoples. These Ossets, who are
the only aborigines of Aryan speech in Caucasia,
are by Zaborowski<a name="FNanchor_1312_1312" id="FNanchor_1312_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1312_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a> identified with the Alans, who are already
mentioned in the 1st century <small>A.D.</small> and were Scythians of
Iranian speech, blonds, mixed with Medes, and perhaps
descendants of the Massagetae. We know from history that
the Goths and Alans became closely united, and it may be
from the Goths that the Osset descendants of the Alans
(some still call themselves Alans) learned to brew beer. Elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_1313_1313" id="FNanchor_1313_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a>
Zaborowski represents the Ossets as of European
origin, till lately for the most part blonds, though now showing
many Scythian traits. But they are not physically Iranians
"despite the Iranian and Asiatic origin of their language," as
shown by Max Kowalewsky<a name="FNanchor_1314_1314" id="FNanchor_1314_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1314_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a>. On the whole, therefore, the
Ossets may be taken as originally blond Europeans, closely
blended with Scythians, and later with the other modern
Caucasus peoples, who are mostly brown brachys. But Ernest
Chantre<a name="FNanchor_1315_1315" id="FNanchor_1315_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a> allies these groups to their brown and brachy Tatar
neighbours, and denies that the Ossets are the last remnants
of Germanic immigrants into Caucasia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Caucasus
Aborigines.</div>

<p>We have therefore in the Caucasus a very curious and
puzzling phenomenon&mdash;several somewhat distinct
groups of aborigines, mainly of de Lapouge's
Alpine type, but all except the Ossets speaking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
an amazing number of non-Aryan stock languages. Philologists
have been for some time hard at work in this linguistic
wilderness, the "Mountain of Languages" of the early Arabo-Persian
writers, without greatly reducing the number of
independent groups, while many idioms traceable to a single
stem still differ so profoundly from each other that they are
practically so many stocks. Of the really distinct families the
more important are:&mdash;the <i>Kartweli</i> of the southern slopes,
comprising the historical Georgian, cultivated since the
5th century, the Mingrelian, Imeritian, Laz of Lazistan, and
many others; the <i>Cherkess</i> (Circassian), the <i>Abkhasian</i> and
<i>Kabard</i> of the Western and Central Caucasus; the <i>Chechenz</i>
and <i>Lesghian</i>, the <i>Andi</i>, the <i>Ude</i>, the <i>Kubachi</i> and <i>Duodez</i> of
Daghestan, <i>i.e.</i> the Eastern Caucasus. Where did this babel
of tongues come from? We know that 2500 years ago the
relations were much the same as at present, because the Greeks
speak of scores of languages current in the port of Dioscurias
in their time. If therefore the aborigines are the "sweepings
of the plains," they must have been swept up long before the
historic period. Did they bring their different languages with
them, or were these specialised in their new upland homes?
The consideration that an open environment makes for uniformity,
secluded upland valleys for diversity, seems greatly to
favour the latter assumption, which is further strengthened by
the now established fact that, although there are few traces of
the Palaeolithic epoch, the Caucasus was somewhat thickly
inhabited in the New Stone Age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Iranians.</div>

<p>Crossing into Irania we are at once confronted with totally
different conditions. For the ethnologist this region comprises,
besides the tableland between the Tigris and
Indus, both slopes of the Hindu-Kush, and the
Pamir, with the uplands bounded south and north by the upper
courses of the Oxus and the Sir-darya. Overlooking later
Mongolo-Turki encroachments, a general survey will, I think,
show that from the earliest times the whole of this region has
formed part of the Caucasic domain; that the bulk of the
indigenous populations must have belonged to the dark, round-headed
Alpine type; that these, still found in compact masses
in many places, were apparently conquered, but certainly
Aryanised in speech, in very remote prehistoric times by long-headed
blond Aryans of the <span class="smcap">Iranic</span> and <span class="smcap">Galchic</span> branches,
who arrived in large numbers from the contiguous Eurasian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
steppe, mingled generally with the brachy aborigines, but also
kept aloof in several districts, where they still survive with
more or less modified proto-Aryan features. Thus we are at
once struck by the remarkable fact that absolute uniformity of
speech, always apart from late Mongol intrusions, has prevailed
during the historic period throughout Irania, which has been
in this respect as completely Aryanised as Europe itself; and
further, that all current Aryan tongues, with perhaps one trifling
exception<a name="FNanchor_1316_1316" id="FNanchor_1316_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a>, are members either of the Iranic or the Galchic
branch of the family. Both Iranic and Galchic are thus rather
linguistic than ethnic terms, and so true is this that a philologist
always knows what is meant by an Iranic language,
while the anthropologist is unable to define or form any clear
conception of an Iranian, who may be either of long-headed
Nordic or round-headed Alpine type. Here confusion may be
avoided by reserving the historic name of <span class="smcap">Persian</span><a name="FNanchor_1317_1317" id="FNanchor_1317_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a> for the
former, and comprising all the Alpines under the also time-honoured
though less known name of <span class="smcap">Tajiks</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Tajiks.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Afghans.</div>

<p>Khanikoff has shown that these Tajiks constitute the
primitive element in ancient Iran. To the true Persians of
the west, as well as to the kindred Afghans in
the east, both of dolicho type, the term is rarely
applied. But almost everywhere the sedentary and agricultural
aborigines are called Tajiks, and are spoken of as
<i>Parsiv&aacute;n</i>, that is, <i>Parsizab&aacute;n</i><a name="FNanchor_1318_1318" id="FNanchor_1318_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1318_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a>, "of Persian speech," or else
<i>Dihk&aacute;n</i><a href="#Footnote_1318_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a>, that is, "Peasants," all being mainly husbandmen
"of Persian race and tongue<a name="FNanchor_1319_1319" id="FNanchor_1319_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1319_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a>." They form endless tribal, or
at least social, groups, who keep somewhat aloof from their
proto-Aryan conquerors, so that, in the east especially, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>ethnic fusion is far from complete, the various sections of the
community being still rather juxtaposed than fused in a single
nationality. When to these primeval differences is added the
tribal system still surviving in full vigour amongst
the intruding Afghans themselves, we see how
impossible it is yet to speak of an Afghan nation, but only of
heterogeneous masses loosely held together by the paramount
tribe&mdash;at present the <i>Durani</i> of Kabul.</p>

<p>The Tajiks are first mentioned by Herodotus, whose
<i>Dadikes</i><a name="FNanchor_1320_1320" id="FNanchor_1320_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1320_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a> are identified by Hammer and Khanikoff with them<a name="FNanchor_1321_1321" id="FNanchor_1321_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1321_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a>.
They are now commonly divided into Lowland, and Highland
or Hill Tajiks, of whom the former were always Parsiv&aacute;n,
whereas the Hill Tajiks did not originally speak Persian at
all, but, as many still do, an independent sister language called
Galchic, current in the Pamir, Zerafshan and Sir-darya uplands,
and holding a somewhat intermediate position between the
Iranic and Indic branches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Galcha.</div>

<p>This term Galcha, although new to science, has long been
applied to the Aryans of the Pamir valleys, being identified
with the <i>Calcienses populi</i> of the lay Jesuit
Benedict Goez, who crossed the Pamir in 1603,
and describes them as "of light hair and beard like the
Belgians." Meyendorff also calls those of Zerafshan "Eastern
Persians, Galchi, Galchas." The word has been explained to
mean "the hungry raven who has withdrawn to the mountains,"
probably in reference to those Lowland Tajiks who
took refuge in the uplands from the predatory Turki hordes.
But it is no doubt the Persian <i>galcha</i>, a peasant or clown, then
a vagabond, etc., whence <i>galchagi</i>, rudeness.</p>

<p>As shown by J. Biddulph<a name="FNanchor_1322_1322" id="FNanchor_1322_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1322_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a>, the tribes of Galchic speech
range over both slopes of the Hindu-Kush, comprising the
natives of Sarakol, Wakhan, Shignan, Munjan (with the
Yidoks of the Upper Lud-kho or Chitral river), Sanglich, and
Ishkashim. To these he is inclined to add the Pakhpus and
the Shakshus of the Upper Yarkand-darya, as well as those of
the Kocha valley, with whom must now be included the
Zerafshan Galchas (Maghians, Kshtuts, Falghars, Machas and
Fans), but not the Yagnobis. All these form also one ethnic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
group of Alpine type, with whom on linguistic grounds Biddulph
also includes two other groups, the Khos of Chitral
with the Siah Posh of Kafiristan, and the Sh&iacute;ns (Dards), G&oacute;rs,
Chil&aacute;si and other small tribes of the Upper Indus and side
valleys, all these apparently being long-heads of the blond
Aryan type. Keeping this distinction in view, Biddulph's
valuable treatise on the Hindu-Kush populations may be
followed with safety. He traces the Galcha idioms generally
to the old Baktrian (East Persia, so-called "Zend Avesta"),
the Sh&iacute;n however leaning closely to Sanskrit, while Khowar,
the speech of the Chitrali (Khos), is intermediate between
Baktrian and Sanskrit. But differences prevail on these details,
which will give occupation to philologists for some time to
come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Galcha and
Tajik Types.</div>

<p>Speaking generally, all the Galchas of the northern slopes
(most of Biddulph's first group) are physically connected with
all the other Lowland and Hill Tajiks, with whom
should also probably be included Elphinstone's<a name="FNanchor_1323_1323" id="FNanchor_1323_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1323_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a>
southern Tajiks dwelling south of the Hindu-Kush
(Kohistani, Berraki, Purmuli or Fermuli, Sirdehi,
Sistani, and others scattered over Afghanistan and northern
Baluchistan). Their type is pronouncedly Alpine, so much so
that they have been spoken of by French anthropologists as
"those belated Savoyards of Kohistan<a name="FNanchor_1324_1324" id="FNanchor_1324_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1324_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a>." De Ujfalvy, who
has studied them carefully, describes them as tall, brown or
bronzed and even white, with ruddy cheeks recalling the
Englishman, black or chestnut hair, sometimes red and even
light, smooth, wavy or curly, full beard, brown, ruddy or blond
(he met two brothers near Penjakend with hair "blanc comme
du lin"); brown, blue, or grey eyes, never oblique, long,
shapely nose slightly curved, thin, straight lips, oval face, stout,
vigorous frame, and round heads with cephalic index as high
as 86.50. This description, which is confirmed by Bonvalot
and other recent observers, applies to the Darwazi, Wakhi,
Badakhshi, and in fact all the groups, so that we have beyond
all doubt an eastern extension of the Alpine brachycephalic
zone through Armenia and the Bakhtiari uplands to the
Central Asiatic highlands, a conclusion confirmed by the
explorations of M. A. Stein in Chinese Turkestan and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
Pamirs (1900-8)<a name="FNanchor_1325_1325" id="FNanchor_1325_1325"></a><a href="#Footnote_1325_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a>. Indeed this Asiatic extension of the Alpine
type inclines v. Luschan<a name="FNanchor_1326_1326" id="FNanchor_1326_1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1326_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a> to regard the European branch as
one offshoot, and the high and narrow ("Hittite") nosed type
as another, or rather as a specialised group, of which the
Armenians, Persians, Druses, and other sectarian groups of
Syria and Asia Minor represent the purest examples. According
to his summary of this complicated region "All
Western Asia was originally inhabited by a homogeneous
melanochroic race, with extreme hypsi-brachycephaly and
with a 'Hittite' nose. About 4000 <small>B.C.</small> began a Semitic
invasion from the south-east, probably from Arabia, by people
looking like the modern Bedawy. Two thousand years later
commenced a second invasion, this time from the north-west,
by xanthrochroous and long-headed tribes like the modern
Kurds, half savage, and in some way or other, perhaps, connected
with the historic Harri, Amorites, Tamehu and
Galatians<a name="FNanchor_1327_1327" id="FNanchor_1327_1327"></a><a href="#Footnote_1327_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethnic Relations
in
India.</div>

<p>But the eventful drama is not yet closed. Arrested perhaps
for a time by the barrier of the Hindu-Kush and Sulim&aacute;n
ranges, proto-Aryan conquerors burst at last,
probably through the Kabul river gorges, on to
the plains of India, and thereby added another
world to the Caucasic domain. Here they were brought face
to face with new conditions, which gave rise to fresh changes
and adaptations resulting in the present ethnical relations in
the peninsula. There is good reason to think that in this
region the leavening Aryan element never was numerous,
while even on their first arrival the Aryan invaders found the
land already somewhat thickly peopled by the aborigines<a name="FNanchor_1328_1328" id="FNanchor_1328_1328"></a><a href="#Footnote_1328_1328" class="fnanchor">[1328]</a>.</p>

<p>The marked linguistic and ethnical differences between
Eastern and Western Hindustan have given rise to the theory
of two separate streams of immigration, perhaps continued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
over many centuries<a name="FNanchor_1329_1329" id="FNanchor_1329_1329"></a><a href="#Footnote_1329_1329" class="fnanchor">[1329]</a>. The earlier entered from the north-west,
bringing their herds and families with them, whose
descendants are the homogeneous and handsome populations
of the Punjab and Rajputana. Later swarms entered by way
of the difficult passes of Gilgit and Chitral, a route which made
it impossible for their women to accompany them. "Here they
came in contact with the Dravidians; here by the stress of
that contact caste was evolved; here the Vedas were composed
and the whole fantastic structure of orthodox ritual and usage
was built up.... The men of the stronger race took to themselves
women of the weaker, and from these unions was evolved the
mixed type which we find in Hindustan and Bihar<a name="FNanchor_1330_1330" id="FNanchor_1330_1330"></a><a href="#Footnote_1330_1330" class="fnanchor">[1330]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Classification
of Types.</div>

<p>An attempt to analyse the complicated ethnic elements
contained in the vast area of India was made by
H. H. Risley<a name="FNanchor_1331_1331" id="FNanchor_1331_1331"></a><a href="#Footnote_1331_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a>, who recognised seven types, his
classification being based on theories of origin.</p>

<p>1. The <span class="smcap">Turko-Iranian</span> type, including the <i>Baloch</i>,
<i>Brahui</i>, and <i>Afghans</i> of Baluchistan and the North-West
Frontier Provinces, all Muhammadans, with broad head, long
prominent nose, abundant hair, fair complexion and tall stature.</p>

<p>2.  <span class="smcap">Indo-Aryan</span> type in the Punjab, Rajputana and
Kashmir, with its most conspicuous members the <i>R&aacute;jputs</i>,
<i>Khatri</i> and <i>J&aacute;ts</i> in all but colour closely resembling the
European type and showing little difference between upper and
lower social strata. Their characteristics are tall stature, fair
complexion, plentiful hair on face, long head, and narrow
prominent nose.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Aryo-Dravidian</span> or Hindustani type in the United
Provinces, parts of Rajputana, Bihar, and Ceylon, with lower
stature, variable complexion, longish head, and a nose index
exactly corresponding to social station.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Scytho-Dravidian</span> of Western India, including the
<i>Maratha Brahmans</i>, <i>Kunbi</i>, and <i>Coorgs</i>, of medium stature,
fair complexion, broad head with scanty hair on the face, and
a fine nose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span></p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Dravidian</span>, generally regarded as representing the
indigenous element. The characteristics are fairly uniform
from Ceylon to the Ganges valley throughout Madras, Hyderabad,
the Central Provinces, Central India and Chota Nagpur,
and the name is now used to include the mass of the population
unaffected by foreign (Aryan, Scythian, Mongoloid) immigration.
The <i>Nairs</i> of Malabar and the <i>Santal</i> of Chota
Nagpur are typical representatives. The stature is short,
complexion very dark, almost black, hair plentiful with a
tendency to curl, head long and nose very broad<a name="FNanchor_1332_1332" id="FNanchor_1332_1332"></a><a href="#Footnote_1332_1332" class="fnanchor">[1332]</a>.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Mongolo-Dravidian</span> or Bengali type of Bengal and
Orissa, showing fusion with Tibeto-Burman elements. The
stature is medium, complexion dark, and head conspicuously
broad, nose variable.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Mongoloid</span> of the Himalayas, Nepal, Assam, and
Burma, represented by the <i>Kanet</i> of Lahoul and Kulu, the
<i>Lepcha</i> of Darjiling, the <i>Limbu</i>, <i>Murmi</i> and <i>Gurung</i> of Nepal,
the <i>Bodo</i> of Assam and the <i>Burmese</i>. The stature is short, the
complexion dark with a yellowish tinge, the hair on the face
scanty. The head is broad with characteristic flat face and
frequently oblique eyes.</p>

<p>This classification while more or less generally adopted in
outline is not allowed to pass unchallenged, especially with
regard to the theories of origin implied. Concerning the
brachycephalic element of Western India Risley's belief that
it was the result of so-called "Scythian" invasions is not
supported by sufficient evidence. "The foreign element is
certainly Alpine, not Mongolian, and it may be due to a
migration of which the history has not been written<a name="FNanchor_1333_1333" id="FNanchor_1333_1333"></a><a href="#Footnote_1333_1333" class="fnanchor">[1333]</a>." Ramaprasad
Chanda<a name="FNanchor_1334_1334" id="FNanchor_1334_1334"></a><a href="#Footnote_1334_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a> goes further and traces the broad-headed
elements in both "Scytho-Dravidians" (Gujaratis, Marathas
and Coorgs) and "Mongolo-Dravidians" (Bengalis and
Oriyas) to one common source, "the <i>Homo alpinus</i> of the
Pamirs and Chinese Turkestan," and attempts to reconstruct
the history of the migration of the Alpine invaders from
Central Asia over Gujarat, Deccan, Bihar and Bengal. His
conclusions are supported by the reports of Sir Aurel Stein of
the <i>Homo Alpinus</i> type discovered in the region of Lob Nor,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
dating from the first centuries <small>A.D.</small> This type "still supplies
the prevalent element in the racial constitution of the indigenous
population of Chinese Turkestan, and is seen in its purest
form in the Iranian-speaking tribes near the Pamirs<a name="FNanchor_1335_1335" id="FNanchor_1335_1335"></a><a href="#Footnote_1335_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a>."</p>

<p>But any scheme of classification must be merely tentative,
subject to modification as statistics of the vast area are
gradually collected. And W. Crooke<a name="FNanchor_1336_1336" id="FNanchor_1336_1336"></a><a href="#Footnote_1336_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a>, while acknowledging
the value of Risley's scheme<a name="FNanchor_1337_1337" id="FNanchor_1337_1337"></a><a href="#Footnote_1337_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a> points out the need of caution in
accepting measurements of skull and nose forms applied to the
mixed races and half-breeds which form the majority of the
people. "The race migrations are all prehistoric, and the amalgamation
of the races has continued for ages among a people to
whom moral restraints are irksome and unfamiliar. The existing
castes are quite a modern creation, dating only from the later
Buddhist age." "The present population thus represents the
flotsam and jetsam collected from many streams of ethnical
movement, and any attempt to sort out the existing races into
a set of pigeon-holes, each representing a defined type of race,
is, in the present state of our knowledge, impossible<a name="FNanchor_1338_1338" id="FNanchor_1338_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1338_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Kols.</div>

<p>In features, says Dalton, the Kols<a name="FNanchor_1339_1339" id="FNanchor_1339_1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_1339_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a> show "much variety,
and I think in a great many families there is a considerable
admixture of Aryan blood. Many have high
noses and oval faces, and young girls are at times<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
met with who have delicate and regular features, finely-chiselled
straight noses, and perfectly formed mouths and chins. The
eyes, however, are seldom so large, so bright, and gazelle-like
as those of pure Hindu maidens, and I have met strongly
marked Mongolian features. In colour they vary greatly, the
copper tints being about the most common [though the Mirzapur
Kols are very dark]. Eyes dark brown, hair black,
straight or wavy [as all over India]. Both men and women
are noticeable for their fine, erect carriage and long, free stride<a name="FNanchor_1340_1340" id="FNanchor_1340_1340"></a><a href="#Footnote_1340_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Dravidians.</div>

<p>The same variations are found among the Dravidians,
where, as should be expected, there are many aberrant groups
showing divergences in all directions, as amongst
the <i>Kurumba</i> and <i>Toda</i> of the Nilgiris, the
former approximating to the Mongol, the latter to the Aryan
standard. W. Sikemeier, who lived amongst them for years,
notes that "many of the Kurumbas have decided Mongoloid
face and stature, and appear to be the aborigines of that region<a name="FNanchor_1341_1341" id="FNanchor_1341_1341"></a><a href="#Footnote_1341_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a>."
The same correspondent adds that much nonsense has been
written about the Todas, who have become the trump card
of popular ethnographists. "Being ransacked by European
visitors they invent all kinds of traditions, which they found
out their questioners liked to get, and for which they were
paid." Still the type is remarkable and strikingly European,
"well proportioned and stalwart, with straight nose, regular
features and perfect teeth," the chief characteristic being the
development of the hairy system, less however than amongst
the Ainu, whom they so closely resemble<a name="FNanchor_1342_1342" id="FNanchor_1342_1342"></a><a href="#Footnote_1342_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a>. From the illustrations
given in Thurston's valuable series one might be tempted
to infer that a group of proto-Aryans had reached this extreme
limit of their Asiatic domain, and although W. H. R. Rivers
has cleared away the mystery and established links between
the Todas and tribes of Malabar and Travancore, the problem
of their origin is not yet entirely solved<a name="FNanchor_1343_1343" id="FNanchor_1343_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_1343_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a>.</p>

<p>The Dravidians occupy the greater part of the Deccan,
where they are constituted in a few great nations&mdash;Telugus
(Telingas), Tamils (numbers of whom have crossed into Ceylon
and occupied the northern and central parts of that island,
working in the coffee districts), Kanarese, and the Malayalim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
of the west coast. These with some others were brought at
an early date under Aryan (Hindu) influences, but have preserved
their highly agglutinating Dravidian speech, which has
no known affinities elsewhere, unless perhaps with the language
of the Brahuis, who are regarded by many as belated Dravidians
left behind in East Baluchistan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dravidian and
Aryan
Languages.</div>

<p>But for this very old, but highly cultivated Dravidian
language, which is still spoken by about 54 millions between
the Ganges and Ceylon, it would no longer be
possible to distinguish these southern Hindus
from those of Aryan speech who occupy all the
rest of the peninsula together with the southern slopes of the
Hindu-Kush and parts of the western Himalayas. Their main
divisions are the Kashmiri, many of whom might be called
typical Aryans; the Punjabis with several sub-groups, amongst
which are the Sikhs, religious sectaries half Moslem half Hindu,
also of magnificent physique; the Gujaratis, Mahratis, Hindis,
Bengalis, Assamis, and Oraons of Orissa, all speaking Neo-Sanskritic
idioms, which collectively constitute the Indic branch
of the Aryan family. Hindustani or Urdu, a simplified form
of Hindi current especially in the Doab, or "Two waters,"
the region between the Ganges and Jumna above Allahabad,
has become a sort of <i>lingua franca</i>, the chief medium of intercourse
throughout the peninsula, and is understood by certainly
over 100 millions, while all the population of Neo-Sanskritic
speech numbered in 1898 considerably over 200 millions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hindu
Castes.</div>

<p>Classification derives little help from the consideration of
caste, whatever view be taken of the origin of this institution.
The rather obvious theory that it was introduced
by the handful of Aryan conquerors to prevent
the submergence of the race in the great ocean
of black or dark aborigines, is now rejected by many investigators,
who hold that its origin is occupational, a question
rather of social or industrial pursuits becoming hereditary in
family groups than of race distinctions sanctioned by religion.
They point out that the commentator's interpretation of the
<i>Pancha Ksitaya</i>, "Five Classes," as <i>Br&aacute;hmans</i> (priests),
<i>Kshatriyas</i> (fighters), <i>Vaisya</i> (traders), <i>Sudra</i> (peasants and
craftsmen of all kinds), and <i>Nish&aacute;da</i> (savages or outcasts) is
recent, and conveys only the current sentiment of the age.
It never had any substantial base, and even in the comparatively
late Institutes of Manu "the rules of food, connubium<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
and intercourse between the various castes are very different
from what we find at present"; also that, far from being
eternal and changeless, caste has been subject to endless
modifications throughout the whole range of Hindu myth and
history. Nor is it an institution peculiar to India, while even
here the stereotyped four or five divisions neither accord with
existing facts, nor correspond to so many distinct ethnical
groups.</p>

<p>All this is perfectly true, and it is also true that for
generations the recognised castes, say, social pursuits, have
been in a state of constant flux, incessantly undergoing processes
of segmentation, so that their number is at present past
counting. Nevertheless, the system may have been, and
probably was, first inspired by racial motives, an instinctive
sense of self-preservation, which expressed itself in an informal
way by local class distinctions which were afterwards sanctioned
by religion, but eventually broke down or degenerated into
the present relations under the outward pressure of imperious
social necessities<a name="FNanchor_1344_1344" id="FNanchor_1344_1344"></a><a href="#Footnote_1344_1344" class="fnanchor">[1344]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oceanic
Indonesians.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Micronesians.</div>

<p>Beyond the mainland and Ceylon no Caucasic peoples of
Aryan speech are known to have ranged in neolithic or prehistoric
times.  But we have already followed
the migrations of a kindred<a name="FNanchor_1345_1345" id="FNanchor_1345_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_1345_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a>, though mixed race,
here called <span class="smcap">Indonesians</span>, into Malaysia, the
Philippines, Formosa, and the Japanese Archipelago, which
they must have occupied in the New Stone Age. Here there
occurs a great break, for they are not again met till we reach
Micronesia and the still more remote insular groups beyond
Melanesia. In Micronesia the relations are extremely
confused, because, as it seems, this group
had already been occupied by the Papuans from New Guinea
before the arrival of the Indonesians, while after their arrival
they were followed at intervals by Malays perhaps from the
Philippines and Formosa, and still later by Japanese, if not
also by Chinese from the mainland. Hence the types are
here as varied as the colour, which appears, going eastwards,
to shade off from the dark brown of the Pelew and Caroline
Islanders to the light brown of the Marshall and Gilbert groups,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
where we already touch upon the skirts of the true Indonesian
domain<a name="FNanchor_1346_1346" id="FNanchor_1346_1346"></a><a href="#Footnote_1346_1346" class="fnanchor">[1346]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Polynesians.</div>

<p>A line drawn athwart the Pacific from New Zealand
through Fiji to Hawaii will roughly cut off this domain from
the rest of the Oceanic world, where all to the
west is Melanesian, Papuan or mixed, while all
to the right&mdash;<i>Maori</i>, some of the eastern <i>Fijians</i>, <i>Tongans</i>,
<i>Samoans</i>, <i>Tahitians</i>, <i>Marquesans</i>, <i>Hawaiians</i> and <i>Easter
Islanders</i>&mdash;is grouped under the name <span class="smcap">Polynesian</span>, a type
produced by a mixture of Proto-Malayan and Indonesian.
Dolichocephaly and mesaticephaly prevail throughout the
region, but there are brachycephalic centres in Tonga, the
Marquesas and Hawaiian Islands. The hair is mostly black
and straight, but also wavy, though never frizzly or even
kinky. The colour also is of a light brown compared to
cinnamon or caf&eacute;-au-lait, and sometimes approaching an almost
white shade, while the tall stature averages 1.72 m. (5 ft. 7&frac34; ins.).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Migrations.</div>

<p>Migrating at an unknown date eastwards from the East
Indian archipelago<a name="FNanchor_1347_1347" id="FNanchor_1347_1347"></a><a href="#Footnote_1347_1347" class="fnanchor">[1347]</a>, the first permanent settlements appear
to have been formed in Samoa, and more particularly
in the island of <i>Savaii</i>, originally <i>Savaiki</i>,
which name under divers forms and still more divers
meanings accompanied all their subsequent migrations over
the Pacific waters. Thus we have in Tahiti <i>Havaii</i><a name="FNanchor_1348_1348" id="FNanchor_1348_1348"></a><a href="#Footnote_1348_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a>, the
"universe," and the old capital of Raiatea; in Rarotonga
<i>Avaiki</i>, "the land under the wind"; in New Zealand <i>Hawaiki</i>,
"the land whence came the Maori"; in the Marquesas <i>Havaiki</i>,
"the lower regions of the dead," as in <i>to fenua Havaiki</i>, "return
to the land of thy forefathers," the words with which the
victims in human sacrifices were speeded to the other world;
lastly in <i>Hawaii</i>, the name of the chief island of the Sandwich
group.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Polynesian
Culture.</div>

<p>The Polynesians are cheerful, dignified, polite, imaginative
and intelligent, varying in temperament between the wild and
energetic and politically capable Maori to his
indolent and politically sterile kinsmen to the
north, who have been unnerved by the unvarying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
uniformity of temperature. Wherever possible, they are agriculturalists,
growing yams, sweet potatoes and taro. Coconuts,
bread-fruit and bananas form the staple food in many islands.
Scantily endowed with fertile soil and edible plants the Polynesians
have gained command over the sea which everywhere
surrounds them, and have developed into the best seamen
among primitive races. Large sailing double canoes were
formerly in use, and single canoes with an outrigger are still
made. Native costume for men is made of bark cloth, and
for women ample petticoats of split and plaited leaves. Ornaments,
with the exception of flowers, are sparingly worn.
The bow and arrow are unknown, short spears, clubs and
slings are used, but no shields. The arts of writing, pottery
making, loom-weaving and the use of metals were, with few
exceptions, unknown, but mat-making, basketry and the making
of <i>tapa</i> were carried to a high pitch, and Polynesian bark-cloth
is the finest in the world.</p>

<p>Throughout Polynesia the community is divided into nobles
or chiefs, freemen and slaves, which divisions are, by reason
of <i>tabu</i>, as sharp as those of caste. They fall into those which
participate in the divine, and those which are wholly excluded
from it. Women have a high position, and men do their fair
share of work. Polygyny is universal, being limited only by
the wealth of the husband, or the numerical preponderance
of the men. Priests have considerable influence, there are
numerous gods, sometimes worshipped in the outward form of
idols, and ancestors are deified.</p>

<p>Polynesian culture has been analysed by W. H. R. Rivers<a name="FNanchor_1349_1349" id="FNanchor_1349_1349"></a><a href="#Footnote_1349_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a>,
and the following briefly summarises his results. At first sight
the culture appears very simple, especially as regards language
and social structure, while there is a considerable degree of
uniformity in religious belief. Everywhere we find the same
kind of higher being or god and the resemblance extends even
to the name, usually some form of the word <i>atua</i>. In material
culture also there are striking similarities, though here the
variations are more definite and obvious, and the apparent
uniformity is probably due to the attention given to the customs
of chiefs, overlooking the culture of the ordinary people where
more diversity is discoverable.</p>

<p>There is much that points to the twofold nature of Polynesian
culture. The evidence from the study of the ritual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
indicates the presence of two peoples, an earlier who interred
their dead in a sitting posture like the dual people of Melanesia<a name="FNanchor_1350_1350" id="FNanchor_1350_1350"></a><a href="#Footnote_1350_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a>,
and a later, who became chiefs and believed in the need for
the preservation of the dead among the living. All the evidence
available, physical and cultural, points to the conjecture that
the early stratum of the population of Polynesia was formed
by an immigrant people who also found their way to Melanesia.</p>

<p>The later stream of settlers can be identified with the kava-people<a href="#Footnote_1350_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a>.
Kava was drunk especially by the chiefs, and the
accompanying ceremonial shows its connection with the higher
ranks of the people. The close association of the <i>Areoi</i> (secret
society) of eastern Polynesia with the chiefs is further proof.
Thus both in Melanesia and in Polynesia the chiefs who preserved
their dead are identified with the founders of secret
societies&mdash;organisations which came into being through the
desire of an immigrant people to practise their religious rites
in secret.  Burial in the extended position occurs in Tikopia,
Tonga and Samoa&mdash;perhaps it may have been the custom of
some special group of the kava-people. Chiefs were placed
in vaults constructed of large stones&mdash;a feature unknown elsewhere
in Oceania. It is safe also to ascribe the human design
which has undergone conventionalisation in Polynesia to the
kava-people. The geometric art through which the conventionalisation
was produced belonged to the earlier inhabitants
who interred their dead in the sitting position.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Polynesian
Communism.</div>

<p>Money, if it exists at all, occupies a very unimportant place
in the culture of the people. There is no evidence of the use of
any object in Polynesia with the definite scale
of values which is possessed by several kinds
of money in Melanesia. The Polynesians are
largely communistic, probably more so than the Melanesians,
and afford one of the best examples of communism in property
with which we are acquainted. This feature may be ascribed
to the earlier settlers. The suggestion that the kava-people
never formed independent communities in Polynesia, but were
accepted at once as chiefs of those among whom they settled
would account for the absence of money (for which there was
no need), and the failure to disturb in any great measure the
communism of the earlier inhabitants. Communism in property
was associated with sexual communism. There is evidence
that Polynesian chiefs rarely had more than one wife, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
the licentiousness which probably stood in a definite relation
to the communism of the people is said to have been more
pronounced among the lower strata of the community. Both
communism and licentiousness appear to have been much less
marked in the Samoan and Tongan islands, and here there is
no evidence of interment in the sitting position. These and
other facts support the view that the influence of the kava-people
was greater here than in the more eastern islands:
probably it was greatest in Tikopia, which in many respects
differs from other parts of Polynesia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magic and
Religion.</div>

<p>Magic is altogether absent from the culture of Tikopia
and it probably took a relatively unimportant place throughout
Polynesia. In Tikopia the ghosts of dead ancestors
and relatives as well as animals are <i>atua</i>
and this connotation of the word appears to be
general in other parts of Polynesia. These may be regarded
as the representatives of the ghosts and spirits of Melanesia.
The <i>vui</i> of Melanesia may be represented by the <i>tii</i> of Tahiti,
beings not greatly respected, who had to some extent a local
character. This comparison suggests that the ancestral ghosts
belong to the culture of the kava-people, and that the local
spirits are derived from the culture of the people who interred
their dead in the sitting position, from which people the dual
people of Melanesia derived their beliefs and practices.</p>

<p>To sum up. Polynesian culture is made up of at least two
elements, an earlier, associated with the practice of interring
the dead in a sitting position, communism, geometric art, local
spirits and magical rites, and a later, which practised preservation
of the dead. These latter may be identified with the
kava-people while the earlier Polynesian stratum is that which

(1896) Kretschmer connects the inscriptions of the Veneti in north Italy and of the
Messapians in the south with the Illyrian linguistic family, which he regards as
Aryan intermediate between the Greek and the Italic branches, the present Albanian
being a surviving member of it. In the same Illyrian family W. M. Lindsay would
also include the "Old Sabellian" of Picenum, "believed to be the oldest inscriptions
on Italian soil. The manifest identity of the name <i>Aodatos</i> and the word <i>meitimon</i>
with the Illyrian names <span class = "greek" title = "Audata">&#913;&#8016;&#948;&#940;&#964;&#945;</span> and <i>Meitima</i> is almost sufficient of itself to prove
these inscriptions to be Illyrian. Further the whole character of their language,
with its Greek and its Italic features, corresponds with what we know and what we
can safely infer about the Illyrian family of languages" (<i>Academy</i>, Oct. 24, 1896).

Achaians, that, in all probability, the general introduction of iron into Greece is to
be assigned. The invaders came ultimately from the Danube region, where iron
was probably first used in Europe, whereas their kindred, the Achaians, had possibly
already lived in Thessaly in the Stone Age, and derived the knowledge of metal
from the Aegeans. The speedy victory of the new-comers over the older Aryan
inhabitants of Northern Greece may be ascribed to their possession of iron weapons."
Ridgeway, however, has little difficulty in proving that the Achaeans themselves were
tall fair Celts from Central Europe. <i>The Early Age of Greece</i>, 1901, especially chap.

<h2>APPENDIX A. (p. 5)</h2>


<div class="pblockquot"><p>Since the first few pages of this book were in print an important
memoir on the "Phylogeny of Recent and Extinct
Anthropoids with Special Reference to the Origin of Man"
has been published by W. K. Gregory (<i>Bull. Am. Mus. Nat.
Hist.</i> Vol. <small>XXXV.</small>, Article XIX, pp. 258 ff., New York, 1916).
As Gregory's lucid statement of the problems involved is based
on a prolonged examination of very varied and abundant
material we have considered it advisable to present his summary.
The chief conclusions, which appear to be of a conservative
character, are as follows (p. 341).</p></div>


<h4><i>The Origin of Man.</i></h4>

<p>1. Comparative anatomical (including embryological) evidence
alone has shown that man and the anthropoids have been derived
from a primitive anthropoid stock and that man's existing relatives
are the chimpanzee and the gorilla.</p>

<p>2. The chimpanzee and gorilla have retained, with only minor
changes, the ancestral habits and habitus in brain, dentition, skull and
limbs, while the forerunners of the Hominid&aelig;, through a profound
change in function, lost the primitive anthropoid habitus, gave up arboreal
frugivorous adaptations and early became terrestrial, bipedal
and predatory, using crude flints to cut up and smash the varied food.</p>

<p>3. The ancestral chimpanzee-gorilla-man stock appears to be represented
by the Upper Miocene genera <i>Sivapithecus</i> and <i>Dryopithecus</i>,
the former more closely allied to, or directly ancestral to, the Hominid&aelig;,
the latter to the chimpanzee and gorilla.</p>

<p>4. Many of the differences that separate man from anthropoids of
the <i>Sivapithecus</i> type are retrogressive changes, following the profound
change in food habits above noted. Here belong the retraction of the
face and dental arch, the reduction in size of the canines, the reduction
of the jaw muscles, the loss of the prehensile character of the hallux.
Many other differences are secondary adjustments in relative proportions,
connected with the change from semi-arboreal, semi-erect and
semi-quadrupedal progression to fully terrestrial bipedal progression.
The earliest anthropoids being of small size doubtless had slender limbs;
later semi-terrestrial semi-erect forms were probably not unlike a very
young gorilla, with fairly short legs and not excessively elongate arms.
The long legs and short arms of man are due, I believe, to a secondary
readjustment of proportions. The very short legs and very long arms
of old male gorillas may well be a specialization.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span></p>

<p>5. At present I know no good evidence for believing that the separation
of the Hominid&aelig; from the Simiid&aelig; took place any earlier than
the Miocene, and probably the Upper Miocene. The change in structure
during this vast interval (two or more million years) is much
greater in the Hominid&aelig; than in the conservative anthropoids, but it
is not unlikely that during a profound change of life habits evolution
sometimes proceeds more rapidly than in the more familiar cases where
uninterrupted adaptations proceed in a single direction.</p>

<p>6. <i>Homo heidelbergensis</i> appears to be directly ancestral to all the
later Hominid&aelig;.</p>


<h4><i>On the evolution of human food habits.</i></h4>

<p>While all the great apes are prevailingly frugivorous, and even
their forerunners in the Lower Oligocene have the teeth well adapted
for piercing the tough rinds of fruits and for chewing vegetable food,
yet they also appear to have at least a latent capacity for a mixed
diet. The digestive tract, especially of the chimpanzee and gorilla, is
essentially similar to that of man and at least some captive chimpanzees
thrive upon a mixed diet including large quantities of fruits,
vegetables and bread and small quantities of meat<a name="FNanchor_1352_1352" id="FNanchor_1352_1352"></a><a href="#Footnote_1352_1352" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a>. Mr R. L. Garner,
who has spent many years in studying the African anthropoids in
their wild state, states<a name="FNanchor_1353_1353" id="FNanchor_1353_1353"></a><a href="#Footnote_1353_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a> that "their foods are mainly vegetable, but
that flesh is an essential part of their diet." Other observers state<a name="FNanchor_1354_1354" id="FNanchor_1354_1354"></a><a href="#Footnote_1354_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a>
that the gorilla and chimpanzee greedily devour young birds as well
as eggs, vermin and small rodents.</p>

<p>Even the existing anthropoids, although highly conservative both
in brain development and general habits, show the beginning of the
use of the hands, and trained anthropoids can perform quite elaborate
acts. At a time when tough-rined tubers and fruits were still the main
element of the diet the nascent Hominid&aelig; may have sought out the
lairs and nesting places of many animals for the purpose of stealing
the young and thus they may have learned to fight with and kill the
enraged parents. They had also learned to fight in protecting their own
nesting places and young. And possibly they killed both by biting, as
in carnivores, and by strangling, or, in the case of a small animal, by
dashing it violently down.</p>

<p>We may conceive that the Upper Tertiary ape-men, in the course
of their dispersal from a south central Asiatic centre<a name="FNanchor_1355_1355" id="FNanchor_1355_1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1355_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a>, entered regions
where flint-bearing formations were abundant. In some way they
learned perhaps that these "Eolith" flints could be used to smash
open the head of a small strangled animal, to crack open tough vegetables,
or to mash substances into an edible condition. Much later,
after the mental association of hand and flint had been well established,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
they may have struck at intruders with the flints with which they were
preparing their food and in this way they may have learned to use the
heavier flints as hand axes and daggers. At a very early date they
learned to throw down heavy stones upon an object to smash it, and
this led finally to the hurling of flints at men and small game. Very
early also they had learned to swing a heavy piece of wood or a heavy
bone as a weapon. For all such purposes shorter and stockier arms
are more advantageous than the long slender arms of a semi-quadrupedal
ancestral stage and I have argued above (p. 333) that a secondary
shortening and thickening of the arms ensued.</p>

<p>One of the first medium-sized animals that the nascent Hominid&aelig;
would be successful in killing was the wild boar, which in the Pleistocene
had a wide Pal&aelig;arctic distribution.</p>

<p>From the very first the ape-men were more or less social in habits
and learned to hunt in packs. Whether the art of hunting began in
south central Asia or in Europe, perhaps one of the first large animals
that men learned to kill after they had invaded the open country was
the horse, because, when a pack of men had surrounded a horse, a
single good stroke with a coup-de-poing upon the brain-case might be
sufficient to kill it.</p>

<p>I have argued above (p. 321) that the retraction of the dental arch
and the reduction of the canines is not consistent with the use of meat
as food, because men learned to use rough flints, in place of their teeth,
to tear the flesh and to puncture the bones, and because the erect incisors,
short canines and bicuspids were highly effective in securing a
powerful hold upon the tough hide and connective tissue. It must be
remembered that with a given muscular power small teeth are more
easily forced into meat than large teeth.</p>

<p>After every feast there would be a residuum of hide and bones which
would gradually assume economic value. The hides of animals were
at first rudely stripped off simply to get at the meat. Small sharp-edged
natural flints could be used for this purpose as well as to cut
the sinews and flesh. After a time it was found that the furry sides of
these hides were useful to cover the body at night or during a storm.
Thus the initial stage in the making of clothes may have been a byproduct
of the hunting habit.</p>

<p>Dr Matthew (<i>loc. cit.</i> pp. 211, 212) has well suggested that man
may have learned to cover the body with the skins of animals in a cool
temperate climate (such as that on the northern slopes of the Himalayas)
and that afterward they were able to invade colder regions. The
use of rough skins to cover the body must have caused exposure to
new sources of annoyance and infection, but we cannot affirm that
natural selection was the cause of the reduction of hair on the body
and of the many correlated modifications of glandular activity. We
can only affirm that a naked race of mammals must surely have had
hairy ancestors and that the loss of hair on the body was probably
subsequent to the adoption of predatory habits.</p>

<p>The food habits of the early Hominid&aelig;, and thus indirectly the
jaws and teeth, were later modified through the use of fire for softening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
the food. Men had early learned to huddle round the dying embers
of forest fires that had been started by lightning, to feed the fire-monster
with branches, and to carry about firebrands. They learned eventually
that frozen meat could be softened by exposing it to the fire. Thus
the broiling and roasting of meat and vegetables might be learned
even before the ways of kindling fire through percussion and friction
had been discovered. But the full art of cooking and the subsequent
stages in the reduction of the jaws and teeth in the higher races probably
had to await the development of vessels for holding hot water,
perhaps in neolithic times.</p>

<p>This account of the evolution of the food habits of the Hominid&aelig;
will probably be condemned by experimentalists, who have adduced
strong evidence for the doctrine that "acquired characters" cannot be
inherited. But, whatever the explanation may be, it is a fact that progressive
changes in food-habits and correlated changes in structure
have occurred in thousands of phyla, the history of which is more or
less fully known. Nobody with a practical knowledge of the mechanical
interactions of the upper and lower teeth of mammals, or of the progressive
changes in the evolution of shearing and grinding teeth, can
doubt that the dentition has evolved <i>pari passu</i> with changes in food
habits. Whether, as commonly supposed, the food habits changed before
the dentition, or <i>vice versa</i>, the evidence appears to show that the
Hominid&aelig; passed through the following stages of evolution:</p>

<p>1. A chiefly frugivorous stage, with large canines and parallel rows
of cheek teeth (cf. <i>Sivapithecus</i>).</p>

<p>2. A predatory, omnivorous stage, with reduced canines and convergent
tooth rows (cf. <i>Homo heidelbergensis</i>).</p>

<p>3. A stage in which the food is softened by cooking and the dentition
is more or less reduced in size and retrograde in character, as in
modernized types of <i>H. sapiens</i>.</p>

<p>The following explanation is offered for the convenience
of those who may not be familiar with the technical terms
here employed.</p>

<div class="pblockquot"><p><i>Simia</i>, the genus containing the orang-utan.</p>

<p><i>Pan</i>, a name occasionally employed for the genus containing the chimpanzee.
Most authorities place the chimpanzee and the gorilla in
the genus Anthropopithecus.</p>

<p><i>Hylobatin&aelig;</i>, the sub-family containing the gibbons.</p>

<p><i>Pal&aelig;opithecus</i>, <i>Dryopithecus</i>, <i>Pal&aelig;osimia</i>, and <i>Sivapithecus</i> are extinct
simians.</p>

<p><i>Pan vetus</i> is the name suggested by Miller<a name="FNanchor_1356_1356" id="FNanchor_1356_1356"></a><a href="#Footnote_1356_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a> for the supposed chimpanzee
whose jaw was found associated with the Piltdown cranium.
He says "The Piltdown remains include parts of a brain-case
showing fundamental characters not hitherto known except in
members of the genus <i>Homo</i>, and a mandible, two molars, and an
upper canine showing equally diagnostic features hitherto unknown,
except in members of the genus <i>Pan</i> [<i>Anthropopithecus</i>].
On the evidence furnished by these characters the fossils must be
supposed to represent either a single individual belonging to an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>otherwise unknown extinct genus (<i>Eoanthropus</i>) or to two individuals
belonging to two now-existing families (<i>Hominid&aelig;</i> and <i>Pongid&aelig;</i>)."
He argues that the jaw was actually that of a chimpanzee
and that the cranium was that of a true man, whom he terms
<i>Homo Dawsoni</i>. Gregory accepts this hypothesis. W. P. Pycraft<a name="FNanchor_1357_1357" id="FNanchor_1357_1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1357_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a>
has submitted Miller's data and conclusions to searching criticism
and bases his deductions on far more ample material than that
at the disposal of Miller. He says "That the Piltdown jaw does
present many points of striking resemblance to that of the chimpanzee
is beyond dispute. Dr Smith Woodward pointed out these
resemblances long ago, in his original description of the jaw. But
Mr Miller contends that because of these resemblances therefore
it <i>is</i> the jaw of a chimpanzee" (<i>loc. cit.</i> p. 408). Pycraft points out
that there is more variability in the jaws of chimpanzees than
Miller was aware of, and that most of the features of the Piltdown
jaw are well within the limits of human variation; in discussing
the conformation of the inner surface of the body of the jaw he
says "Between the two extremes seen in the jaws of chimpanzees
every gradation will be found, but in no case would there be any
possibility of confusing the Piltdown fragment, or any similar
fragment of a modern human jaw, with similar fragments of chimpanzee
jaws" (p. 407).</p></div>

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
